<h1>Menachot 26 - When Remainder of Flour Became Impure</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bTKqDp7OEps/TZqYTfDCttI/AAAAAAAAEyU/JK4ALkYbFho/s1600/Paul+Cezanne+-+Still+Life+Bread+And+Leg+Of+Lamb.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="244" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bTKqDp7OEps/TZqYTfDCttI/AAAAAAAAEyU/JK4ALkYbFho/s320/Paul+Cezanne+-+Still+Life+Bread+And+Leg+Of+Lamb.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">The handful from the flour offering is burned, while the remainder is eaten by the kohanim. What happens if the remainder becomes impure before they have a chance to burn the handful? This is actually the same argument as the one about the Passover lamb offering, where the question was, can one throw the blood if the meat became impure. Rabbi Eliezer, who allows the blood of the Passover lamb to be thrown, would allow the handful of flour to be burned. And Rabbi Yehoshua, who does not allow the blood of the Passover offering to be thrown, would not allow the handful of the flour to be burned.<br />
<br />
The handful of the flour offering was to be put into a service vessel first. If this was not done, the offering was invalid. Rabbi Shimon, however, rules it valid. What is his reason? According to Rabbi Shimon, since the flour offering had to be put into a vessel before service anyway, that was sufficient. <br />
