<h1>Menachot 110 - Whether One Does Much or Little, but with a Pure Heart</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7B8RK1V28cQ/Tgj9gna3hRI/AAAAAAAAFJg/WkvL8oZ3au8/s1600/Gustave+Leonhard+de+Jonghe+-+Kind+Heart.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7B8RK1V28cQ/Tgj9gna3hRI/AAAAAAAAFJg/WkvL8oZ3au8/s320/Gustave+Leonhard+de+Jonghe+-+Kind+Heart.jpg" width="244" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">What does the verse in Malachi mean, "<a href="http://bible.cc/malachi/1-11.htm">For from the rising of the sun to its setting My Name is great among the nations... all will sacrifice for My sake</a>," for we see that this is not so? - This refers to those who study in every place on earth, whom God considers as if they serve Him and bring sacrifices. The verse continues, "and a pure flour offering" - this is talking about the one marries a wife and afterwards continues his studies. <br />
<br />
Why does it says in the Psalms, "<a href="http://bible.cc/psalms/134-1.htm">Bless God, all you servants of God, who stand in the Temple of God in the nights</a>," since we know that the main Temple service is during the day! - This refers to those who study at night, and they are considered as if they they were engaged in the Temple service.<br />
<br />
Why does the Torah say about every sacrifice, big or small, animal, bird, or flour, that it is a "pleasing sweet smell to God?" - to tell you that whether one does much or little, it is equally pleasing to God, if done with a pure heart.<br />
