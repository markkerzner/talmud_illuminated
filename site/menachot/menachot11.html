<h1>Menachot 11 - Too Much Oil</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-q_1DPhqrhSA/TYZYxfcT18I/AAAAAAAAEwI/TSsXeMHy0-Y/s1600/Eastman+Johnson+-+Warming+her+Hands.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-q_1DPhqrhSA/TYZYxfcT18I/AAAAAAAAEwI/TSsXeMHy0-Y/s320/Eastman+Johnson+-+Warming+her+Hands.jpg" width="224" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">How exactly was the kemitzah - taking off a handful of flour - performed? The Kohen would extend his three middle fingers, scoop the flour in them, and close the fingers over the palm of his hand. In the case of flour offerings that were first baked and crumbled into pieces, he would use his thumb and his pinky to break off the protruding pieces.<br />
<br />
If he increased its oil or diminished its oil, or if he diminished its frankincense, it was invalid.<br />
<br />
What does it mean that "he increased its oil?" As Rabbi Elazar explained, that means that he designated two logs (log=.5 liter) instead of 1 log for the standard 5-pound amount. But why did not Rabbi Elazar explain it as adding unsanctified oil? Rabbi Elazar stated his ruling in the form of "I don't have to tell you," namely, "I don't have to tell you that if he added unsactified oil that he made it invalid, since that oil is not fitting, but even if he added too much fitting oil, he still made it invalid." What forced Rabbi Elazar to interpret it this way? - The wording itself, "its oil." <br />
