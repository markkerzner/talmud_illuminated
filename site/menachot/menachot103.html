<h1>Menachot 103 - Flour Offering Obligations and Mistakes</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3HfmR-nu86w/Tf9bd5D_JAI/AAAAAAAAE94/viEeg0zml-0/s1600/Marianne+Preindelsberger+Stokes+-+Polishing+Pans.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="237" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3HfmR-nu86w/Tf9bd5D_JAI/AAAAAAAAE94/viEeg0zml-0/s320/Marianne+Preindelsberger+Stokes+-+Polishing+Pans.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">If one says, "I promise to bring a flour offering on a griddle," and brings instead an offering prepared in a deep pan, then instead of a promised hard loaf he brought a soft and spongy one. He has not fulfilled his obligation and has to bring another offering, but the one he brought is valid. We regard it as another free-will offering. <br />
<br />
However, if he pointed at the flour and said, "This flour is designated to be brought as an offering on a griddle," and instead he made one in a deep pan, his offering is completely invalid. Why is this difference? In the first case, he created a personal obligation, but he was free to bring another additional offering. In the second case of flour designation, the flour acquired the sanctity of a specific type of offering, and this cannot be changed.<br />
<br />
If one promises a flour offering of barley, he nevertheless has to bring one of wheat. His starting words, "flour offering" are considered decisive, and the conclusion "of barley" - which is meaningless, because there are no personal barley offerings - is disregarded.<br />
