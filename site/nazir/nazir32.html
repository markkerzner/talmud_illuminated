However, the Sages imposed upon him a penalty: he cannot even ask about annulment until he behaves properly for as many days as he previously violated by drinking wine. If after all a Sage annulled his vow of being a nazir, and he already separated an animal for the concluding sacrifices - we are back to the argument between Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai. Beit Hillel simply allow the animal to go back to its flock.
<br />
<br />
If one thought that he had an animal to conclude his nazir's vow and declared himself a nazir, but then discovered that the animal was stolen - if it was stolen before the vow, then he is not a nazir. If it was stolen after his vow, then he was a valid nazir for the time that the animal was still in his possession, so his vow is valid.
<br />
<br />
Nachum HaMede made this mistake: he annulled all nazir vows for people who made them close to the  Temple destruction. The Sages corrected him: if they vowed before the destruction, their vows were in fact valid. But they knew that the Second Temple would be destroyed 490 (<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3410.htm">seventy weeks</a> ) years after the the first one, so how could they vow in earnest?! - They still hoped that their period of being a nazir will finish while the Temple was standing.
