A Jewish man can become a nazir, but a non-Jew cannot. Also, a Jewish woman can become a nazir (nazirah), and one can even force his slave to become a nazir.
<br />
<br />
All three rules above are not obvious. Why is it that a non-Jew cannot become a nazir? - Because the Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=6#P3823">Speak to the sons of Israel</a>," but not to other peoples. However, this cannot serve as proof because later, the Torah uses the term "man," which should mean "any man." In fact, a non-Jew can bring sacrifices in the Temple, so why can't  he be a nazir?
<br />
<br />
Perhaps it is because a nazir is not allowed to bury even his father, and maybe for a non-Jew, it is different? - Can't be because inheritance laws apply to all people, including inheriting from the father. Or perhaps it is because a nazir should avoid impurity, and a non-Jew, since he does not go to the Temple and does not have the concept of impurity, cannot be a nazir? - No, that is not convincing either: perhaps he does have a concept of impurity, just that he gets no punishment for being impure!?
<br />
<br />
The Talmud tries a few more attempts but concludes that this rule is impossible to prove. Rabbi Yochanan summarized that God tells this law directly to Moses and not written anywhere in the Torah.
