<br />
Ravina asked a related question, “If someone planted two types of grasses together, is that a forbidden mixture?” Perhaps not, since they were not commanded to grow separately, or maybe yes, since they guessed it on their own?<br />
<br />
Rav Assi asked a question: “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=1#P12">The earth brought forth vegetation on Tuesday</a>, but <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=2#P36">the plants were not there on Friday</a>. That's a contradiction!” He answered, “All vegetation remained underground until Adam prayed for it.” Rav Nachman bar Pappa had a garden. He planted seeds there, but they did not grow. He prayed, the rain came, and they grew. He said, “That is the teaching of Rav Assi!”<br />
