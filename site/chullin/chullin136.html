<span style="font-size: medium;">When the Torah say "your" in singular, it refers both to each individual Jew, and to the whole Jewish people. Therefore, the law it discusses applies to an individual as well as to a partnership. For example, when it says, "The first of your (singular) fleece give to a kohen," this applies also to sheep of partners. Rabbi Ilai disagrees and holds that "your" in singular refers to an individual, but partners shearing their flock need not give the first fleece to a kohen.
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, in talking about the first of the fleece, the Torah uses the word "give," and the same word is used in describing the kohen's portion of the grain. This, according to Rabbi Ilai, tells us that just as the kohen's portion of grain is given only in Israel, so too the first fleece is given only in Israel.
<br />
<br />
Finally, the same word "give" is used in describing kohen's gifts. And, just as the kohen's portion of the grain is given only in Israel, it should follow that according to Rabbi Ilai, the kohen's gifts are given only in Israel. Rabbi Yose said, "Indeed, that is the opinion of Rabbi Ilai."
