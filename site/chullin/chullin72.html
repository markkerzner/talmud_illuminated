The severed limb itself is impure: if the fetus was alive, the limb was severed from a live animal and has the impurity of a dead animal (<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">nevelah</a>); and if the fetus was dead, the limb is actual nevelah.<br />
<br />
If one first slaughtered its mother and then severed the foreleg, then the flesh of the fetus is impure because it touched the limb - so says Rabbi Meir. However, the Sages say that flesh is impure with a special light impurity decreed by the Sages, which would only make a difference in the case of sacrifices.<br />
<br />
All agree that kosher slaughter makes the meat ritually pure. Why? Logically, one could even argue that should be impure, like non-kosher animals. However, since a kosher animal was fit for food when it was young, its slaughter purifies the meat even if it later became a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">terefah</a> (sick), whereas non-kosher ones were never fit.<br />
