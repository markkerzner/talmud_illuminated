<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FJkv5H9UmIY/TjBLP51PBBI/AAAAAAAAFTs/g1vBOFASgTQ/s1600/Hans+Memling+-+Portrait+of+a+Man+with+an+Arrow.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FJkv5H9UmIY/TjBLP51PBBI/AAAAAAAAFTs/g1vBOFASgTQ/s320/Hans+Memling+-+Portrait+of+a+Man+with+an+Arrow.jpg" width="258" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">If one chopped off the head of an animal, the shechitah is invalid because it must be done with a drawn-out, saw-like motion. Therefore, if he cut the head off with one motion, it is valid - provided that the knife was twice as long as the neck, so that he can accomplish the cut without going back and forth. If he used the back-and-forth motion, it is valid, and then the knife can be as small as a scalpel. If he cut off two animal heads in one motion, it is valid, provided that the knife is thrice as long as one neck. Two people can do a shechitah together, as long as they don't press.<br />
<br />
Rava examined an arrow for Rav Yonah, found it smooth, and then Rav Yonah slaughtered with it a bird in flight. But perhaps the arrow entered the side of the neck and burrowed between the pipes? - They saw that the feathers around the neck were sliced. But they need to cover the blood of the bird both below and above? - They plowed the whole field over which the bird was flying, and thus the loose earth served for covering below.<br />
