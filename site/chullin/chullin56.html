<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qqlZ46_Kvko/TlFVWNVPUDI/AAAAAAAAFaQ/GLEIn9glF8c/s1600/Wallerant+Vaillant+-+Young+Sportsman+with+Rabbit+and+Fowl.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qqlZ46_Kvko/TlFVWNVPUDI/AAAAAAAAFaQ/GLEIn9glF8c/s320/Wallerant+Vaillant+-+Young+Sportsman+with+Rabbit+and+Fowl.jpg" width="271" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">These are the cases of terefah in fowl: a bird whose esophagus was punctured, or one whose trachea was severed. If a weasel struck (bit) it on its head in a place that makes it a terefah, that is, opposite the brain, and there is a concern that the brain membrane may have been punctured. If the gizzard was punctured, or if the intestines were punctured.<br />
<br />
If a fowl fell into fire and its internal organs were scorched, then if they turned green, it is terefah, but if they remained red, it is kosher. If one trod on a fowl or knocked it against the wall, or if an animal crushed it, then if it fluttered and remained alive for twenty-four hours, and one then slaughtered it, it is kosher.<br />
