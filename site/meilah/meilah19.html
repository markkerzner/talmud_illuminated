Also, if he used one article but caused deterioration in another - he is still not liable, since both the amount of benefit and of deterioration must be at least a perutah.
<br />
<br />
Misappropriation cannot be committed twice. For example, if one used a Temple's ax, it became deconsecrated through his action. Now if he or someone else uses it again, they do not commit misappropriation. The exception to this rule are sacrificial animals and Temple vessels: since they cannot be redeemed, they cannot be deconsecrated either, and if people rode on a sacrificial animal one after another, they have all committed misappropriation.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah the Prince states a rule: whatever cannot be redeemed is subject to misappropriation after misappropriation. But that is the same as the first teacher!? - Rabbi Yehudah refers to <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/03/menachot-21-wooden-blocks-are-also.html">his own opinion that we saw a while back</a>, that if one donates wooden blocks, they are viewed as a sacrifice, and other blocks of wood are needed to burn these ones. Accordingly, donated wood cannot be redeemed, and one who uses it commits misappropriation.
