Items consecrated to be brought on the Altar combine with one another for misappropriation. For example, if one ate half an olive volume of meat of an animal sacrifice, and another half an olive volume from another, he committed misappropriation, because he ate an olive volume of Temple's property. Additionally, if those half-olive volumes were of  sacrifices left beyond permitted time, and he ate the total volume of an olive, he is liable to be cut off from his spiritual source. Two half-olive volumes of something fit for Temple treasury but not for the Altar also combine. Finally, even meat of a sacrifice and meat consecrated to the Treasury, also combine with one another for prohibition.
<br />
<br />
Actually, the last rule is the biggest unexpected teaching of them all, and it should be sufficient to teach just that, and we would deduce the rest. However, the first part of the rule mentions meat left over, which is specific to sacrifices, and thus had to be taught separately.
<br />
<br />
The five different components of burned offering: meat, forbidden fat, flour, wine, and oil - all combine with one another for form a complete olive volume for &nbsp;misappropriation. The six components of a thanksgiving offering - the five above plus loaves - also combine.
