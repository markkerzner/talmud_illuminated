<br />
<br />
In addition, if three people ate together, they must call each other to join in this prayer. This is true even if the food they ate had some limitations. For example, in the case of food from which tithes may not have been separated - still, since one can renounce all his possessions, become  poor, and be free of the obligation to tithe.
<br />
<br />
This joining in prayer removes the obstacles on the way of the prayer and allows it to rise up; and also brings an additional level of joy. What is the source for it? - It is this phrase: "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=32#P5756">When I proclaim&nbsp;God's name, praise God for His greatness</a>."<br />
