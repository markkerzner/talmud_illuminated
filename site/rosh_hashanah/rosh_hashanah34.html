<h1>Rosh Hashanah 34 - How important is the shofar?</h1>
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--_CM2QLp21I/U5nfvI64RII/AAAAAAAATR4/c1LjvqrhvkA/s1600/Square+in+an+Ancient+City+by+Jean+Lemaire.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="231" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--_CM2QLp21I/U5nfvI64RII/AAAAAAAATR4/c1LjvqrhvkA/s1600/Square+in+an+Ancient+City+by+Jean+Lemaire.jpg" width="320" /></a>If one heard the nine required sounds of the shofar in nine hours, one sound an hour, he has nevertheless fulfilled his obligation. There is no requirement for them to be adjacent to each other. However, if he heard them simultaneously from nine people, he has not fulfilled his obligation because he could not hear each sound clearly.<br />
<br />
It is better to be with those who know how to blow the shofar than with those who know how to pray. For example, if in one city they blow the shofar but do not know the prayers, and in another city they say the prayers but do not blow the shofar, he should go to the first city. 
<br />
<br />
But this rule seems obvious; why did the teacher have to state it? After all, the shofar requirement is from the Torah. The prayer was later decreed by the Sages. Of course, we should prefer to do the Torah commandment! Still, the rule contains a novelty. Even when it is doubtful whether they will blow the shofar, one should still go and try to hear it.<div><br />
