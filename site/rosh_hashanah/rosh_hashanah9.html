At the end of every seventh Shmita year (that is, every 49 years) there is a Jubilee year. What day does it start on? - First of Tishrei, which thus becomes the New Year for the Jubilee. In that year Jewish slaves must be set free; any land bought in the last 49 years goes back to its ancestral owners; and this is also a Shmita year, when nobody works the land. The sign of all of this is the blowing of the Shofar at the end of Yom Kippur. Therefore, for the ten days between the Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur slaves cannot go home yet, but they are already not slaves. Instead, they eat and drink and sit with their crowns (or turbans, sign of a free man), and their masters now serve them.
<br />
<br />
There is another opinion, however, that the Jubilee year starts after Yom Kippur, and not in any way before – which results in no feast for the slaves. It also results in the fact that the Jubilee year is the fiftieth year, following the Shmita, as opposed to coinciding with the last Shmita year. 
<br />
<br />
There is also a principle of taking some time away from the regular minutes or days and adding it to the sanctified time. Some derive it from the laws of Shmita – which is extended both before and after the actual year. Other use Yom Kippur as a trend-setting example: since the Torah mentioned the affliction as starting on the ninth, the day before Yom Kippur, this teaches to add a little from the day before to the Yom Kippur itself. Others, however, say that overeating before Yom Kippur is considered an affliction and is thus a mitzvah.
