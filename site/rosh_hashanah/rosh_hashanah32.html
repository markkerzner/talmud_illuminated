<h1>Rosh Hashanah 32 - The prayers of Rosh Hashanah</h1>

Every theme is expressed by ten phrases. When these are said, we also blow the shofar. However, often they blow the shofar later in the prayer not to disturb the people's concentration.
<br />
<br />
There is a rule that mitzvot must be perform early and without delay. How can they delay the blowing of the shofar, which is the mitzvah of the day for Rosh Hashanah? - There was once a government decree against blowing the shofar, and it was delayed, not to arouse suspicion. It was kept in place later, out of concern that a similar decree might happen again. 
<br />
<br />
With all the importance of the shofar, one may not do the following to bring it on Rosh Hashanah: carry it from afar, ride a horse, dig it up from the rubble, nor swim in water for it. One may clean it with water or wine. If a child wants to play the shofar, not only he is not stopped, but they help him learn, even on Shabbat.
