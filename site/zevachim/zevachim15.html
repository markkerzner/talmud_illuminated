<h1>Zevachim 15 - Carrying without Walking</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TO9IO5g5jHI/AAAAAAAAEXU/_BI2Dyg2zLI/s1600/Jan+Victors+-+Hannah+Giving+Her+Son+Samuel+to+the+Priest.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="291" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TO9IO5g5jHI/AAAAAAAAEXU/_BI2Dyg2zLI/s320/Jan+Victors+-+Hannah+Giving+Her+Son+Samuel+to+the+Priest.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">If a Kohen carries the blood of a sacrifice without walking, that is, he stands in place and hands the blood to another person who is closer to the Altar, is this a valid service? <br />
<br />
They tried to answer this question based on another rule: if a Kohen is sitting, he is disqualified from carrying the blood. It must be, therefore, that when he is standing, he can carry the blood! - No, because maybe by "sitting" the rule means moving by dragging himself in a sitting position. No proof can be deduced from here!<br />
<br />
They tried to answer the question from a different rule: on Passover, the sacrifice would be slaughtered by its owner, and a Kohen would receive the blood, pass it to his fellow, and so on until it reached the Altar. We see from here that one does not have to walk! - No, we don't see it - perhaps they moved a little. Then why were they many? The service of God is better with many.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yochanan concluded, "Conveying the blood without moving one's feet is not a valid service."<br />
