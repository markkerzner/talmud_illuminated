<h1>Zevachim 67 - Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Eliezer Argue About a Bird Burnt-Offering</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TTMuM0_FZII/AAAAAAAAEeg/oiouMAZ3qFI/s1600/Melchior+de+Hondecoeter+-+Birds+In+A+Park+1686.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="273" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TTMuM0_FZII/AAAAAAAAEeg/oiouMAZ3qFI/s320/Melchior+de+Hondecoeter+-+Birds+In+A+Park+1686.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">If a Kohen took a bird that was sanctified by its owner as a burnt-offering and proceeded to bring it as a sin offering, then Rabbi Eliezer says that one commits misappropriation if he misuses it, but Rabbi Yehoshua says that misappropriation is not committed. <br />
<br />
What is their argument? Rabbi Eliezer's line of reasoning is this. As soon as the owner consecrated the bird as a burnt-offering, it became Temple property, subject to the law of misappropriation. It never lost this status, and thus is forbidden to use.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehoshua, on the other hand, says that if the Kohen changed the burnt-offering with regard to designation, procedure, and location, and did all as if it were a sin-offering, it became transformed into a sin-offering, at least as far as the law of misappropriation is concerned, and there is no punishment for its misuse. Rabbi Yehoshua agrees that the Kohen still should not eat it.<br />
