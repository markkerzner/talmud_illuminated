<h1>Zevachim 102 - Was Moses a Kohen?</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-G9OSPBwUnOc/TWHKm9gRBlI/AAAAAAAAEqM/w3yKqt4HzYw/s1600/Jules+Charles+Boquet+-+Mourning.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-G9OSPBwUnOc/TWHKm9gRBlI/AAAAAAAAEqM/w3yKqt4HzYw/s320/Jules+Charles+Boquet+-+Mourning.jpg" width="252" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">Rav made the following statement: "Our teacher Moses was a High Priest and shared in the offerings - as the Torah says, '<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/8-29.htm">from the ram of inauguration was a portion of Moses</a>'". Now he had to face the challenges.<br />
<br />
In the previous argument with Aaron about eating the sin-offering, why didn't Moses eat it himself, for he, unlike them, was not precluded by mourning? Rav answered - he was busy talking to God from morning till evening.<br />
<br />
When Miriam contracted leprosy, it was not Moses, who was not a kohen, who pronounced her status, and not Aaron, who was a relative, but it was God himself, who also was a kohen, Who confined her and later released her. We see from this that Moses was not a kohen!  - No, maybe leprosy is specifically given to the sons of Aaron to decide.<br />
<br />
In truth this is an&nbsp;</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">argument found</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;between earlier authorities of the Mishna, for when God became angry with Moses for refusing to go Egypt, this, unlike all other angers, left no mark - so says Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korcha. However, Rabbi Shimon says that this anger too left a mark, and Aaron became a kohen instead of Moses, who thus remained a Levi.<br />
