<br />
Rabbi Eliezer says, "Let the kohen place all these limbs on the Altar, and I view the sin-offering (which is not supposed to be burned) as if it were mere wood." But the Sages say that the limbs must be left until the next morning, when they  become invalidated as "leftovers", and then they can be burned together with all other invalidated offerings, in a place specially designated for this.<br />
<br />
What is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer? After all, the Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/2-12.htm">They may not go on the Altar for satisfying aroma</a>..."  Rabbi Eliezer says, "for satisfying aroma they should not go, but they can go on the Altar as fuel for fire."<br />
