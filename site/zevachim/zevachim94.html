<h1>Zevachim 94 - Laundering is a stringency of sin-offering</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0XNMJEq3ozY/TVd71Qs-4EI/AAAAAAAAEoI/Hoaq2bkCbhw/s1600/Edward+Stott+-+The+Washing+Day.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="289" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0XNMJEq3ozY/TVd71Qs-4EI/AAAAAAAAEoI/Hoaq2bkCbhw/s320/Edward+Stott+-+The+Washing+Day.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though the Torah talks about blood spattering on a garment, we can generalize it, and include everything that can be laundered like a garment, and everything that can become ritually impure like a garment - since even the smallest piece of a garment is usable and therefore can accept ritual impurity.<br />
<br />
If the blood of a sin-offering spattered on a hide, then if the hide was not yet stripped from the animal, it does not require washing (because it cannot be a garment yet), but if it was stripped from the animal, then it does require washing (because the skin can be designated for use as a mat by the owner in his mind) - these are the words of Rabbi Yehudah. However, Rabbi Elazar says that until it becomes a garment, and is not merely designated for use, it cannot accept ritual impurity and thus does not require washing.<br />
<br />
Only the place of the blood requires laundering, and it must be done in the Courtyard. So too must the  earthenware be shattered in the Courtyard. Thus laundering is a stringency possessed by the sin-offering over other most holy offerings. <br />
