<h1>Zevachim 48 - Why Do Most Holy Sacrifices Require North?</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TRrSIVZZ6UI/AAAAAAAAEbk/brguiGMXNg8/s1600/Jan+Steen+-+The+Severe+Teacher.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TRrSIVZZ6UI/AAAAAAAAEbk/brguiGMXNg8/s320/Jan+Steen+-+The+Severe+Teacher.jpg" width="312" /></a></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Following most holy sacrifices require slaughter in the northern side of the Courtyard: the bull and he-goat of Yom Kippur; the communal offerings of bull and goat that are completely burnt; the communal and the private sin-offerings; the burnt offering; and the communal peace- and guilt-offerings.<br />
<br />
The Torah mentioned the north requirement in connection with the burnt offering. Why did the teacher not list this first? Because this requirement for the sin-offering was derived using the rules of Torah exposition, and as such, it was more beloved to him. The teacher used it to sharpen the minds of his students.<br />
<br />
What is this derivation? "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/6-25.htm">In the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered shall the sin-offering be slaughtered</a>." <br />
