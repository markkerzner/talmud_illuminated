<h1>Zevachim 16 - Who Cannot Do Sacrificial Service</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TO_rRxQQG6I/AAAAAAAAEXc/t1fhJJEMp6I/s1600/Pierre+Auguste+Renoir+-+The+Artists+Family.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TO_rRxQQG6I/AAAAAAAAEXc/t1fhJJEMp6I/s320/Pierre+Auguste+Renoir+-+The+Artists+Family.jpg" width="256" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">The following categories of people, if they receive the blood of the sacrifice, invalidate the offering:<br />
<br />
A non-Kohen. Only the priests who are the descendants of Aharon can serve in the Temple. The Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/22-2.htm">Speak to Aaron and to his sons that they shall separate themselves from the holies of the children of Israel and they shall not profane</a>..." <br />
<br />
A kohen whose relative, one of the seven close ones - father, mother, brother, unmarried sister, son, daughter, or spouse - has died this day. Since Aharon was specifically requested to continue the service after his two sons died, "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/21-12.htm">And he need not leave the Sanctuary and he will not profane</a>...", we understand that all other Kohanim would profane the service.<br />
<br />
Although the ruling above mentions only receiving the blood, the same disqualification also applies to the other two steps - carrying the blood and throwing it on the Altar. The slaughter, however, is valid if done by a non-Kohen, since the Torah said, "And he slaughters, and a Kohen receives the blood."<br />
