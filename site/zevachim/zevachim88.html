<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TU8LPJmv-vI/AAAAAAAAEmw/gRAUFzScqhU/s1600/Jan+Van+Eyck+-+Man+in+a+Red+Turban.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TU8LPJmv-vI/AAAAAAAAEmw/gRAUFzScqhU/s320/Jan+Van+Eyck+-+Man+in+a+Red+Turban.jpg" width="235" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">An animal sacrifice is sanctified with an oral declaration by the owner, but offerings like wine and flour require being placed in a Temple vessel. Flour Temple vessels were also used for measuring, having the capacity of one issaron (between 11 to 21 cups). The vessels designated for fluids sanctify liquid offering, and those for dry offerings sanctify only dry offerings, but not the liquid ones.<br />
<br />
If an object used in Temple service became defective, it was never repaired, but completely replaced instead, because of the rule that "there is no place for poverty in the place of opulence." Thus, punctured vessels were completely molted down and made into new vessels, but not patched, and the vestments of the kohanim were only washed from slight dirt, where water alone would be sufficient (and then using soap was allowed), but otherwise they were replaced.<br />
<br />
The trousers worn by the kohanim atoned for immorality, the turban - for arrogant people,  the belt - for improper thoughts of the heart, the breastplate of the High Priest - for wrongly administered justice, his ephod (apron) - for idolatry, the bells on his tunic - for hurtful speech, and the golden plate on his forehead - for brazenness.<br />
