<h1>Zevachim 69 - The Impurity of Swallowing</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TTXcj2VcbAI/AAAAAAAAEfI/AL4U9McNijA/s1600/Pieter+the+Elder+Bruegel+-+Winter+Landscape+with+Skaters+and+a+Bird+Trap+%2528detail%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="167" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TTXcj2VcbAI/AAAAAAAAEfI/AL4U9McNijA/s320/Pieter+the+Elder+Bruegel+-+Winter+Landscape+with+Skaters+and+a+Bird+Trap+%2528detail%2529.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">The two-step derivation of the "impurity of the throat" - that is, the impurity that a dead bird can transmit by swallowing its flesh - is as follows. The Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/17-15.htm">And any person who will eat an animal that died by itself or was torn... - he shall immerse his garments and immerse himself in the water and remain impure until evening and then be pure</a>."</span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;"><br />
</span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;">Furthermore, the Oral Law tells us that this verse is talking only about birds, and not about any animals. As an exception, we have previously learned that <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/01/zevachim-68-when-is-bird-considered.html">if a bird has a melikah applied to it, even in the wrong way - it may not have the law of a bird who died by itself</a>.<br />
<br />
What if the Kohen did a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/01/zevachim-68-when-is-bird-considered.html">melikah</a> to the bird and then it was found to be a "trefah," - possessing a defect that would surely cause its death anyway? Rabbi Meir says that it does not contaminate, and Rabbi Yehudah says that it does.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Meir proves his points of view by comparing with the slaughter of an animal - whose impurity is more strict, and nevertheless the slaughter purifies it - and the same should be true for birds.<br />
