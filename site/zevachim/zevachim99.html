<h1>Zevachim 99 – Which Kohen Does Not Get a Share in the Offerings</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pO2O8bgu0uM/TV34WpDZW1I/AAAAAAAAEpc/BZMKFpsU-Og/s1600/Georges+de+La+Tour+-+Dying+Monk.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="301" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-pO2O8bgu0uM/TV34WpDZW1I/AAAAAAAAEpc/BZMKFpsU-Og/s320/Georges+de+La+Tour+-+Dying+Monk.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">A person whose close relative has died gets the legal status of a mourner (onein) for that day. A kohen who is a mourner is allowed to touch sacrifices – he does not make them ritually impure – but he cannot offer them, and he does not have a claim to a share to eat that night. <br />
<br />
A kohen who has a blemish, whether passing or permanent, does have a share in the offerings and is allowed to eat them, but cannot offer them or do any kind of sacrificial service. <br />
<br />
Any kohen who was disqualified at any point of the service – for example, if he was impure when the blood was thrown but later, when the fats were burned, he became pure – does not have a share in that offering. And one who does not have a share in the meat does not have a share in the hides. This is derived from the Torah phrase “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/7-33.htm">The one from the among the sons of Aharon who offers (that is, who is fit to offer) the blood of the peace offering and the fat – the right thigh shall be his portion</a>.”<br />
