But if the Kohen went ahead and slaughtered it in the South, is it valid? In other words, is this requirement "before" or even "after?" <br />
<br />
Can we say this: since the sin-offering must be slaughtered in the North, and its laws are learnt from the laws of the burnt offering, then of course the burnt offering must be in the North - for we never find that a derived law is stronger than the basic one!<br />
<br />
No, we can't really say it. Take, for example, the second tithe, which may be redeemed for money, but after it was redeemed once, it cannot be redeemed again - which is stronger! - Wrong! The sanctity of second redemption is weaker, not stronger, and that's why it cannot be redeemed.<br />
<br />
Another attempt: take the Passover offering, which does not require libations, but if it is brought after Passover, it does require them! So the second time around it is stronger! - Wrong! It simply becomes a peace offering which requires libations.<br />
<br />
We have deflected all attacks, but anyway we have a better proof, "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/4-29.htm">in the place of the burnt offering</a>" tells us that the burnt offering should stay in its place.<br />
