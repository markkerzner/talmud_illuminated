However, the more maidservants she brings into marriage, the less she has to work, and with four maidservants she just sits in an easy chair. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Eliezer says that she always needs to work, at least with wool, for idleness leads to unchastity, while Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says that idleness brings to insanity.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Chiya disagrees and says that a wife is only for beauty, and she should not do any work that diminishes her beauty. He also taught in another place that a wife is only for adornments, and she should accept them from her husband, while it is his duty to give them to her.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Chiya fulfilled his maxim in life: his wife gave him hard time, and he would nevertheless buy any nice thing he could find, and bring it wrapped up as a present. His theory was that it is enough for a wife to save the husband from sin by appearing beautiful and thus preventing him from looking at other women.
