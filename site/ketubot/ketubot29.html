He is also liable to regular damages for assault: pain, humiliation and depreciation. Furthermore, if she and her father so desire, he must marry her and may never divorce her against her will.
<br />
<br />
This law applies primary to a young girl who just became a bat mitzvah (12 years) and thus an adult, but has not become a more grown-up (12 ½ years). If he rapes a girl who is a mamzer and whom he is prohibited to marry, the penalty still applies. It also applies to all who were converted or ransomed before they were three years of age. 
<br />
<br />
Similarly, if one violates girls who are prohibited to him on the pain of karet (being cut off from the people) – such as his sister, brother's wife divorced before chuppah, or a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/05/niddah-2-presumption-of-ritual-purity.html">niddah</a> – the penalty is the same.
