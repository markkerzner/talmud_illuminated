He may not perform the Temple service and he is not subject to the prohibition against going to the cemetery.<br />
<br />
Women prohibited to a Kohen include a divorcee, a convert, and a woman who cohabited with any man whom she is Biblically forbidden to marry.<br />
<br />
If a male convert marries a female convert, their daughter is allowed to marry a Kohen.
