For poverty is not the result of a trade, nor is wealth the result of a trade; rather, all is in accordance with one's merit."<br />
<br />
Rabbi Nehorai says: "I put aside every trade in the world and I teach my son only Torah, for a man benefits from its reward in this world, and the principal remains for him in the World to Come."<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Mystical meaning of Kiddushin</span><br />
<br />
The bride is symbolic of Tzedek - righteousness and also of being poor. When she is given a coin - a prutah - the minimum amount for giving, she becomes symbolic of Tzedakah, charity. She then turns her face to the groom, and this face-to-face meeting, symbolic of God talking to Moses, prepares them for the honor of Chupah.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Mystical meaning of Chanukah (Since today is Chanukah)</span><br />
<br />
Chanukah is the contrast between "<a href="http://bible.cc/proverbs/31-30.htm">Beauty is vanity but God-fearing woman, she should be praised</a>," and Kiddushin symbolizes this choice.</span>
