For poverty is not the result of a trade, nor is wealth the result of a trade; rather, all is per one's merit."<br />
<br />
Rabbi Nehorai says: "I put aside every trade in the world, and I teach my son only Torah, for a man benefits from its reward in this world, and the principal remains for him in the World to Come."<br />

<br />
The bride is symbolic of Tzedek - righteousness and also of being poor. When given a coin - a prutah - the minimum amount for giving, she symbolizes Tzedakah, charity. She then turns her face to the groom, and this face-to-face meeting, symbolic of God talking to Moses, prepares them for the honor of Chupah.<br /></span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: Bricklayers, From A Series Depicting Trades And Professions by Jan Georg van Vliet</span></div>
