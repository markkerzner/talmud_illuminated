<h1>Kiddushin 45 - Betrothal by a Minor without the Knowledge of Her Father</h1>

She also requires "Refusal", a procedure where the minor says to her husband in court "I do not want you anymore" in case her father has not agreed.<br />
<br />
A certain man betrothed a minor by giving her a bundle of vegetables in the marketplace. Here we are not concerned that the father may acquiesce, because betrothal was not done honorably.
