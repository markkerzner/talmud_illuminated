<br />
* They must be doubled, such as if yes, then.. and if no, then ...<br />
* The stipulation must precede the act, that is, "If you do this, I will marry you..."<br />
* The positive must precede the negative<br />
<br />
This is learned from the conditions that Moshe set, "If the children of Gad and the children of Reuven will cross..." and "But if they will not cross..."<br />
<br />
If these rules are not adhered to, the conditions are void. However, there are other opinions, and one better be careful.
