Why?<br />
<ol>
<li>Husband caused the prohibition, and he also removes it? No, because she is still forbidden to marry his son from the previous marriage or his father.</li>
<li>A widow is forbidden to the Chief Priest, so she must be allowed to marry everyone else? No, perhaps she would still be transgressing a positive commandment.</li>
<li>When Jewish soldiers went to war, "And whichever man betrothed a wife and did not yet take her, let him return, lest he dies in battle and another man takes her" - is a valid proof.</li>
