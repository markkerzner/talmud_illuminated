He said, "Become betrothed to me with $2,000, and here is this silk as payment." The silk was indeed worth $2,000. Does the woman, who is not an appraisal expert, rely on his words and wholeheartedly commit herself to marriage? The prevailing ruling is that she does.<br />
<br />
If a man said to a woman, "Become betrothed to me with $100," but instead gave her an item as collateral, she is not betrothed. She did not receive the promised money, nor was collateral given as a gift.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art:&nbsp;Silks and Satins,&nbsp; 1900 Posters</span></div>
