<br />
When the orphans become adults, they cannot protest the settlement, for if they indeed had such a right, what worth is there in the power of the court?<br />
<br />
Brothers who divide an inheritance are like purchasers of their respective shares. Consequently, if they erred estimating the value and the discrepancy is more than a sixth, the transaction is void.
