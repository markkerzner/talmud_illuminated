Can he do this for his son, who is a minor? Does the phrase "or to his son" mean that the son can be any age or must be like his father, an adult?<br />
<br />
Answer: While a nine-year-old CAN acquire a wife in levirate marriage if his brother dies by having marital relations with her, the designation of a maidservant as a wife is not possible until the son is an adult.<div><br /></div><div>Art: The Proposal by Charles Ã‰douard Delort</div>
