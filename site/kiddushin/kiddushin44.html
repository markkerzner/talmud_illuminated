<br />
Related teaching: a betrothed Naarah whose husband wishes to divorce her, either she or her father can receive her divorce bill (Get), and any girl unable to care for her Get cannot become divorced.<br />
<br />
However, regarding kiddushin, her father accepts the kiddushin, and she can not.<br />
<br />
Can a Naarah appoint an agent to accept her Get? - No - because she has less power than her father, who alone can appoint such an agent.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Painter's daughters with a cat by Gainsborough</div>
