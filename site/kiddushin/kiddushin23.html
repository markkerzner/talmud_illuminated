<br />
Can we derive from here that a Canaanite slave-woman can be acquired by sexual intercourse, because she is lifting her master? - No, this is not comparable to regular lifting where the lifter does not get any pleasure. How about anal intercourse where she is not getting pleasure? Who is to say that she is not getting any pleasure? - Disproved!  A slave-woman can not be acquired in this way.</span>
