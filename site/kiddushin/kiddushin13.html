After she accepted it, those present said to him, “But the mat is not worth a prutah!” He replied, “Let her become betrothed with the four coins which are wrapped inside." The woman retained the money. Is she betrothed?<br />
<br />
Since her silence occurred after the money has been given, it is meaningless, and she is not betrothed.<br />
<br />
If a man betrothed a woman with goods which he grabbed or stole from her, then, if they had previously agreed to marry one another, this betrothal is valid.</span>
