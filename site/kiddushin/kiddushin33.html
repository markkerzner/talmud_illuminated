The Torah continues, "Fear your God," - meaning that one should not avert his eyes pretending that he did not see the sage.<br />
<br />
One is not obligated to suffer monetary loss by standing up in front of a sage; even so, one was obligated to stand up in front of a person who was bringing first fruit to Jerusalem. Why is this? Because a mitzvah in its proper time is especially beloved.
