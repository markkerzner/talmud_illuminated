<h1>Kiddushin 48 - Betrothal with Loan Collection Rights or with Labor</h1>
If a creditor sells a note of indebtedness to his fellow and afterwards forgives the debt - it is indeed forgiven. Therefore, if one betroths a woman by giving her a loan document for collection, she may  fear that he will forgive the debt, and thus she does not wholeheartedly commit herself to the betrothal, which is therefore void.<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/SSzObwMHh4I/AAAAAAAAAfg/ecpXoQ2fe1k/s1600-h/Andries+Vermeulen+-+Still+Life+Jewellery+Casket.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/SSzObwMHh4I/AAAAAAAAAfg/ecpXoQ2fe1k/s200/Andries+Vermeulen+-+Still+Life+Jewellery+Casket.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272816239931524994" style="cursor: pointer; float: left; height: 117px; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; width: 200px;" /></a><br />

If a woman handed a piece of gold to a craftsman and said to him: "Fashion for me anklets, earrings, or rings, and in return for your labor I will become betrothed to you," - it is betrothal with a a loan, which is invalid.
