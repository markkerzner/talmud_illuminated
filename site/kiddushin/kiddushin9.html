Might one think that, since she is obligated to repay, she agrees to marry but is testing him for anger management? - No!<br />
<br />
A certain man was drinking wine in a shop and a woman came and said to him, "Give me a drink." He said, "If I do, will you marry me?" She said, "Give it me!" - This means nothing and she is not betrothed.
