When a man gives a woman money or items worth money and says, "Behold, you are betrothed to me - Harei at mekudeshet li," and she agrees, she is betrothed.<br />
<br />
Anyone who does not know the laws of divorce documents and Kiddushin should have no dealings with them, for an unwitting error in the decision could prove intractable.<br />
<br />
A woman can not be betrothed by forgoing the repayment of a loan. The loan is given for expenses, with the obligation to repay. Thus, he is not giving her anything of value at this  moment.<div><br /></div><div><div>How about a document? A document is drafted by a man, and it states that a woman is hereby betrothed to him. The Kiddushin is effected when the man gives the document to the woman.</div><div><br /></div><div>Why does this work? Because "And she will leave the first husband's house, and she will go and be a wife unto another man." Since "leave" can be effected through a document, so too "be" can be effected through a document.</div><div><br /></div><div>But if so, can divorce be effected by money? - No, because a defender cannot become an accuser. And while the documents would be different and distinct, money would be the same.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Art:&nbsp;A Young Lady and a Cavalier by Frans Francken (III)</div>
