One might think that she does not work to receive Kiddushin money, and thus the father keeps it. Alternatively, one might think that the father feeds her, and thus keeps her earnings.<br />
<br />
Another source why money is effective for Kiddushin is "When a man <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">takes</span> a woman", because Efron said to Avraham, "<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Take</span> this field from me" - for money.<br />
<br />
Efron's reincarnation was Aravna, who sold the location of the Temple to King David honestly and generously, correcting Efron's deed.
