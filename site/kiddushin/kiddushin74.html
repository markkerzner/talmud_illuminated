<br />
Midwife is believed to tell us who is the firstborn - but only immediately after birth, his mother is believed for the first seven days of his life, and his father is believed always, because of "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">...shall recognize the firstborn</a>."<br />
<br />
A mother of a child born out of wedlock is believed if she says that she cohabited with a person who is genealogically fit.
