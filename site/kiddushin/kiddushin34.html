They are also not obligated to learn those areas of the Torah which have no practical applicability nowadays.<br />
<br />
Women are obligated to affix mezuzot to their doorposts, because for this the Torah promises long life, and women need long life just as men do.<br />
<br />
Women are obligated in all the negative commandments of Passover, such as not eating bread, and therefore all of the positive commandments of Passover, such as eating matzah.
