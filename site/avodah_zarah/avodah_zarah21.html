<br />
Selling houses to idol worshippers in Israel is prohibited by the Torah phase, "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">do not give them a holding in the land</a>." Renting was prohibited by the Sages as a precautionary measure, because renting may lead to selling.<br />
<br />
In the case of fields, there is an additional problem, because selling the fields to an idolater removes the obligation to give the priest's portions and the tithes. <br />
<br />
Those are the words of Rabbi Meir. However, Rabbi Yose says that we may rent them houses but not fields.<br />
<br />
Even in a place where they allowed to rent houses to idol worshippers, this is not said with regard to renting a house for use as living quarters, because the old worshipper will inevitably brings idols into the house, thereby placing the Jewish lessor in violation of "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/7-26.htm">You shall not bring an abomination in your house</a>." The latter ruling is not applicable nowadays.<br />
