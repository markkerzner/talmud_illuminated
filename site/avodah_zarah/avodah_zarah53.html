<h1>Avodah Zarah 53 - Idol Nullification</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TKzBYhUe3MI/AAAAAAAAEP0/A7MpxyDH6dk/s1600/John+William+Waterhouse+-+The+HouseholdGods+1880.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TKzBYhUe3MI/AAAAAAAAEP0/A7MpxyDH6dk/s320/John+William+Waterhouse+-+The+HouseholdGods+1880.jpg" width="234" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">A non-Jewish idol worshipper can nullify his own idol and that of his fellow. He needs to be an adult and of sound mind. A Jew cannot nullify the idol of  a non-Jewish idol-worshipper. If a Jew comes into actual possession of an idol, it cannot be nullified but has to be hidden. That law is from the Torah, derived from the phrase "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">And place it in secret.</a>"&nbsp;  However, the Sages have additionally prohibited any idol nullification by a Jew, since he might accidentally pick up it, thus acquiring it, and then his nullification would be invalid.<br />
<br />
How does an idol-worshipper nullify an idol? If he cut off the tip of its ear, the tip of its nose, or the tip of finger, or flattened its face - he has nullified it. But if he spit before it, or urinated before it, or dragged it through the mud, or threw excrement at it - the idol is not nullified. If he sold it or gave it as a pledge for a loan, Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that his nullification is effective, but the Sages say that it is not.<br />
