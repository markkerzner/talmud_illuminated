However, there are gradations. He will not hesitate to let a critically ill Jewish patient die, since this will not harm his reputation. He may also kill a healthy patient, since other pagans will understand that he did it out of malice, not incompetence. Accordingly, one with a non life-threatening illness may go to a pagan doctor.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yochanan suffered from a sickness called tzafdina, a tooth ailment. He went to a certain idolatrous noblewoman for treatment. She made him a remedy on Thursday and Friday, but on Saturday he could not come, because of many students, and asked for a recipe. She said, "Swear that you will not reveal it to anyone!" He said, "To the God of Israel I will not reveal" (but to the people I will), then taught it in public. But he swore?!? - He explained to her the trick right away. Some say that she committed suicide, but some say that she converted, impressed with Rabbi Yochanan's selflessness.<br />
<br />
Now, seeing that Rabbi Yochanan was ready to take the medicine on Saturday, it must have been a life-threatening disease, and if so, how was he allowed to go to an idolatrous doctor? - Rabbi Yochanan was a distinguished person whom the doctor would be afraid to harm.<br />
