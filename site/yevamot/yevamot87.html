Let's look at the possible metamorphoses that she can later go through.
<br />
<br />
If her husband the Kohen dies, but she has a child from him, she can continue to eat terumah, as if her husband was still alive. If she then marries a Levi, she may eat Levi's due from the crop - that is, first tithe ("maasar") but she can't eat terumah any longer. 
<br />
<br />
Here was can note that the author of this ruling is Rabbi Meir, who forbids the first tithe to a non-Levi. 
<br />
<br />
If her husband the Levi dies but she has a child from him, she can still eat maaser. If then she marries a regular Israel, she may not eat either maaser or terumah. If her husband the Israel dies but she has a child from him, she still cannot eat either maaser or terumah. 
<br />
<br />
If her son from the Israel dies, she can again eat maaser, on the account of her child who is a Levi. If her son from a Levi dies, she can now eat terumah, because of her son who is a Kohen. And if that son dies, she again cannot eat either maaser or terumah.
