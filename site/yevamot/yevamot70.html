This is also true for slaves that he acquires. However, if this Kohen is uncircumcised or ritually impure, then he cannot eat terumah. This does not change the status of his family, and they can continue to eat terumah just as they did before - because they are still his family and did not change in any way.<br />
<br />
When a Kohen is uncircumcised, we are not talking about a willful violator, because the Talmud usually does not talk about this group of people, as applicable to the rules of the law. Rather, his two older brother have previously died as a result of circumcision, which left him with the presumption that circumcision is dangerous to his health and should not be done. Still, when he becomes healthy, and experts assert this, the mitzvah of circumcision is again incumbent on him.<br />
<br />
The situation is reverse for a Kohen who has wounded or crushed testicles or whose member is severed. He is prohibited from marrying and cohabiting with a Jewish woman, but this does not take away his status as a Kohen. Therefore, he may still eat terumah. However, his wife is different: once he cohabits with her, she looses the right to terumah, because she had a cohabitation with someone unfit for her.<br />
