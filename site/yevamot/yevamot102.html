<br />
<br />
Chalitzah requires five people: three to <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=25#P5549">act as judges</a> and two - to make the fact well-known. The Kohanim then will know not to marry her, and other people, by contrast, will know that she is available.
<br />
<br />
Part of the procedure is for her to remove his shoe. The shoe should be proper, made from leather, and fit to be worn. As an enhancement, they add a strap to the shoe, so that that the two actions - untying the strap, and the removing the shoe - leave no doubt in the validity of the procedure. 
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yannai asked, "What if she tore the shoe of his foot, or burned it off his foot? Do we need the foot to become exposed - and that is achieved - or do we need proper removal?" - To this there was no answer.
