However, Rabbi Shimon, who usually understands and ascribes reasons for the laws of the Torah, says that the reason here is that a convert may have had relations with someone prohibited to her. Therefore, if a  girl converts  before the age of three, her cohabitation - even if she is violated - does not carry the disqualification power of an adult, and she can marry a Kohen.
<br />
<br />
Another lenient law from Rabbi Shimon: an idolater's grave does not spread ritual impurity under a roof, so that a person in this situation remains pure. Why? - The Torah said, "Man (Adam), when he dies under a roof...transmits impurity." And only Jews are called "Adam," because their souls all come from reincarnations of Adam's soul - which is not true for idolaters. 
<br />
<br />
If a Kohen betrothed a widow (whom he is allowed to marry), and then he was appointed a High Priest, then he can go ahead and fully marry her (which would not be allowed for a regular High Priest). This is learned from the words "... only a virgin shall he take," where the words "shall he take" are extra, alluding to a special case like this where he marries a widow.
<br />
<br />
This situation actually happened with Yehoshua ben Gamla, who betrothed a widow Martha daughter of Baitos, was then appointed High Priest, but proceeded with marriage. In fact, Martha was influential in his appointment: she bought the place of High Priest for her husband with many many pounds of gold coins. But in the end Yehoshua restored Torah study and is remembered for good, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/09/bava-batra-21-restrictions-on.html">as we have learned elsewhere</a>.
