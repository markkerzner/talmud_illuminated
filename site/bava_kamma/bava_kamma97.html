His son Rava inquired about the legal basis for this. The justifications were:<br />
<br />
It costs more to feed the slave than his work is worth, and the master uses it only as a convenience, and Rav Yosef was feeding the slave, thus performing a favor;<br />
<ul>
<li>The master is glad that the slave works in the off-time, because he is not habituated to laziness.</li>
</ul>
Rava said, "True, but when people owe you money, it looks like usury," and his father agreed.
