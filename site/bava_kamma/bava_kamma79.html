If one stole an animal and gave it to another person to slaughter it for him, and he slaughtered it; or he stole an animal and give it to another person to sell it for him, and he sold it - he pays the fourfold or fivefold payment.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Even though the general rule is that "there is no agency for an act of transgression," and normally the agent for sale or slaughter should bear the responsibility, this case is an exception. Since for any sale another person is needed anyway, so here too an agent may be involved for the sale or slaughter.</div>
