The owner's liability in the case of innocent first-time gorings is <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-35.htm">limited to the value of the ox that did the damage</a>, and in the case of established damagers the owner pays pays the full amount of the damage with his best property.<br />
<br />
Regarding what is the foot of an animal considered an established damager? For breaking things in the course of its walking but not when kicking.
