<br />
However, when the words "common characteristic" appear in the Mishnah, this is meant to include something else. What is it?<br />
<br />
Abaye said: "One's stone, knife or burden that he left on top of his roof and they fell down and did damage." Wind makes this case different.<br />
<br />
Rava said: "An object that was left in the public domain (pit category), rolled to another place by the feet of the passerby and damaged there."
