It is this <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-33.htm">case of a pit</a>:<br />
<br />
When an animal falls into the pit and dies, if the pit is at least 10 hand-breadths deep, the owner of the pit is liable. If one person digs the 9 hand-breadths and the second one adds 1 hand-breadth, the second one is liable for all the damage, since he added the lethal quality to the pit.<br />
<br />
The owner of the pit pays the difference between the animal's worth while alive and the <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-36.htm">carcass' value</a>.
