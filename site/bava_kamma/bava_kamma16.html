Thus if a dog killed and ate sheep or a cat killed and ate a chicken, it is a case of unusual damage, and it is not collected in court. This however only applies to large animals, but small animals are "tooth" damage and it can be collected.<br />
<br />
Five damagers are considered unusual and liable for only half-damage: domestic animal to gore, push, bite, squat, and kick. Among the five damagers considered normal, with their owners "warned" of the complete liability: animal while walking ("foot"), ox that already gored, and a man that does damage.<br />
