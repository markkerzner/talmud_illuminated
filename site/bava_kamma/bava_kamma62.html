The house owner needs to take an oath about the value, and has to be reasonably expected to have such items.<br />
<br />
One is liable for direct or immediate damages but not indirect or delayed ones.<br />
<br />
If a camel laden with flax passed through the street and its flax protruded into a shop and was ignited by the shopkeeper's lamp and set fire to a large towner, the owner of the camel is liable; if the shopkeeper put his lamp outside, the shopkeeper is liable. Rabbi Yehuda says that for Hanukkah light he is not liable.<br />
