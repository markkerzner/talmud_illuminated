<span id="formatbar_Buttons" style="display: block;"></span><br />
One who steals after a thief does not pay a twofold payment, because twofold payment applies only when "...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-7.htm">it is stolen from the house of the man</a>...". Likewise, one who slaughters or sells after a thief does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.<br />
