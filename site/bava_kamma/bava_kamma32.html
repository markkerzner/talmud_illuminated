<br />
Said Rabbi Yochanan, - this ruling is only talking about the time right before Shabbat, when running for the sake of Shabbat is allowed, but otherwise the one who runs is liable.<br />
<br />
If one chops wood in the public domain and thereby does damage in the private domain; chops in the private domain and damages in the public; or chops in private and damages in private, he is liable for full damages.
