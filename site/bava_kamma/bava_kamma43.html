What does "<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-29.htm">...and it killed a man or a woman...</a>" &nbsp;teach us? To make the owner of a goring ox liable to redemption payment for the killing of a woman as for a man? No, it is already written: "...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-28.htm">if an ox shall gore a man or a woman</a>..." &nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Rather, to equate a woman with a man in damages: if a man dies before collecting, his damages go to his heirs, so too a woman - her damages go to her heirs and not to her husband - because the husband inherits only the actual assets that the wife possessed at the time of her death.</div>
