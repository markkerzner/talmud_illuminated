One may not take charity from stolen money â€“ because it encourages the thieves to steal, since they erroneously believe that giving stolen money to charity justifies their wrongdoing and exempts them from having to compensate the owner. Examples are money of unjust arbitrary customs and tax collectors, who bought rights to collect what they want.</div>
