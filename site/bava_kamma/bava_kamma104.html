He may not give it to the victim's son, nor to his agent, but he may give it to to an agent of the court.<br />
<br />
The court then holds the stolen property until the victim calls for it. The Rabbis enacted that this should suffice, to ensure that a potential penitent not be discouraged.<br />
<br />
The agent above is informal, but a formal agent appointed with two witnesses can receive the payment.<br /><br />
