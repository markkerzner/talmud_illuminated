"...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-31.htm">whether it gores a boy or it gores a girl</a>..." &nbsp;Wouldn't I know it by logic: a man is liable for killing a man, whether adult or minor, and an ox is liable for killing a man - must be, whether adult of minor? No, man's law is more strict, with liability for pain, cure, etc. Therefore, the verse is needed.<br />
<br />
If an ox was rubbing itself against the wall and the wall collapsed on a man and killed him, or if the ox intended to kill an animal but instead killed man, or to kill a Canaanite but instead killed a Jew, the ox is exempt.</span>
