<div>
A married woman has the ability to sell her Ketubah with the stipulation that if she is widowed or divorced, the buyer will collect the entire face value of the Ketubah, but if she dies during her husband's lifetime, he will receive nothing. Since the buyer makes a significant risk in making such a purchase, the price he pays is steeply discounted form the face value of the Ketubah.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Such a sale should not be made, because a man is not allowed to keep his wife even for one hour without a Ketubah.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
If the wife injures her husband, he can't collect this speculative value of the Ketubah.</div>
