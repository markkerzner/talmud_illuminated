<br />
In the case of one ox worth two hundred <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuz_%28coin%29">zuz</a> that gored another ox worth two hundred and the carcass is worth fifty, one owner takes half of the live ox and half of the dead one, and so does the other. Each party thus suffers half the loss, and the damager can give the carcass as a partial payment.
