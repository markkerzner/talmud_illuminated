Granted that when he slaughters it, it's the property of the Temple, not of the original owner.<br /><br />But when he consecrates it, let this be equivalent to a sale of a stolen animal to the Temple - thus making him liable for a fourfold or fivefold payment? No! Consecration differs from a sale: after consecration the animal is still called "A sacrifice of so-and-so", not a "sacrifice of the Temple."<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a84383/go">Test your knowledge...</a>
