The thief can't consecrate it because it is not his, and the owner can't consecrate it because it is not in his possession."<br />
<br />
But what would be Rabbi Yochanan's source, being that there are Mishnas that rule otherwise?<br />
<br />
His source is another Misha: One who steals a stolen item from a thief does not pay twofold payment. Why not? He doesn't pay the original owner a twofold payment because the article is not the owner's possessions - by the same token the owner can't consecrate it.<br />
