If he slapped him on his cheek, he gives him 200 zuz ($10,000), if he did it with the back of his hand, 400 zuz.<br />
<br />
If he pulled his ear, yanked his hair, spat on him and his spittle reached him, removed his cloak from him, or bared the head of a woman in the marketplace, he gives him (or her) 400 zuz ($20,000).<br />
<br />
This is the general rule: Everything depends on the victim's level of honor, and the amount above are the maximum.<br />
