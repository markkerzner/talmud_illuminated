<br />
Although the robber is his father's heir, he may not keep that which he stole - for he must fulfill the dictate to return stolen property.<br />
<br />
If he doesn't wish or can't pay, he may borrow from others, repay, and his creditors will may then come and collect the debt from his inheritance.<br />
