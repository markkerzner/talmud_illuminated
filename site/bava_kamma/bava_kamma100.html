<br />
If he dyed it poorly, the dyer gets the lesser of the improvement to the wool and his expenses. Since he knew that using inferior dye would result in inferior product, he is a damager. His claim to compensation is that he did in fact increase the value.<br />
<br />
If he was to dye red, and he dyed black, Rabbi Meir says that he pays the value of wool, but Rabbi Yehudah awards the claim as above.<br />
