Chanan the Wicked delivered a blow to the ear of a certain person. Rav Huna said to Chanan: "Give the victim half a zuz." Chanan had a worn-out zuz but couldn't change it. He delivered a second blow to the other ear and gave the person the zuz.</div>

If an ox is warned regarding its own species but not other species, or regarding young animals but not mature animals, the owner pays full damages where warned but half damages where not warned. Students asked Rabbi Yehudah about an ox warned for goring on Sabbath. He said, "for goring on Sabbath he pays full damages, on weekdays, half-damages."</div>
