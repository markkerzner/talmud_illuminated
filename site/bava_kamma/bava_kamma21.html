<br />
Additional support for this ruling comes from "...<a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/24-12.htm">through desolation the gate is broken apart</a>," meaning that demons of desolation ruin the house, or alternatively from the reason that the residents see what needs repair and attend to it. What is the practical difference between these two reasons? Using the house for storing wood ans straw.
