<br />
If the trespasser's ox fell into the homeowner's cistern and fouled its waters, the trespasser is liable. If the homeowners father or his son was in the cistern and was killed by the falling ox, the trespasser must pay redemption reparation. But if he brought his ox into the courtyard with the owner's permission and it was damaged there, the owner of the courtyard is liable.<br />
