<br />
If the father left his children interest money, even if they know that it is interest, they are not obligated to return it - because they have acquired it through the combination of the owner loosing hope to recover it, and the change of ownership domain.<br />
<br />
The court can't accept witnesses' testimony in the absence of the defendant - unless he refuses to come, and there are pressing circumstances.<br />
