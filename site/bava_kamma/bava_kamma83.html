<br />
* for actual damage;<br />
* for pain;<br />
* for healing;<br />
* for loss of employments;<br />
* and for humiliation.<br />
<br />
How do we asses actual damage? If the assailant blinded the victim's eye, cut off his hand, or broke his leg, we view the victim as if he were a servant being sold in the market, and we appraise how much he was worth before he was wounded and how much he is worth now.<br />
