If a son cohabits with his mother who is a harlot, promising her a sheep, that sheep <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/23-18.htm">may not be brought as a sacrifice</a>. She can't sue him for the sheep in court, because of "one is subject only to the greater (death) penalty," so their deal is invalid, but the prohibition takes effect.</div>

If one stole an ox of two partners and then admitted his liability to one of them, - he doesn't pay a fivefold payment to him, but does he pay half of it the other partner? Rav Nachman said, "No! Five oxen and not five half-oxen!" but the next morning he admitted he erred due to fast.</div>
