Although the assailant gives his victim compensation, the assailant is not pardoned by God until he requests forgiveness from him victim, as it says, &nbsp;"And God came to Avimelech in a dream by night and said to him - <a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/20-3.htm">Behold, you are to die</a>... but now, return the man's wife,.. [and appease him enough] so that he will [even] pray for you."</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
And from where do we know that if the victim does not forgive him that the victim is considered cruel? For it says "...<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/20-17.htm">Abraham prayed to God and God healed Avimelech</a>..."</div>
