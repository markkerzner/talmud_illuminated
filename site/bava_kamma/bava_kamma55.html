<br />
If the fold was breached at night, or robbers breached it, he is not liable; if the robbers took the sheep out, the robbers are liable.<br />
<br />
If he left the sheep in the sun or gave it over to an deaf-mute, deranged, or minor and it escaped and damaged, he is liable; if he gave it over to a shepherd, the shepherd assumes the responsibility.<br />
