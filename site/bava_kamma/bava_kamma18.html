Is the utensil considered broken form the start of the process?<br />
<br />
Can we rely on another ruling: if chickens were pecking at the rope of a bucket, and it snapped, and the bucket broke, the owner of the chicken is responsible for damages. Is it because the bucket is broken from the beginning of the fall and thus the chickens are directly responsible? No! Damages for the rope.
