Said Rav Yosef, who was blind but observed all the commandments, "I am glad that the law is not like Rabbi Yehudah because one who is obligated and does is greater."</div>

Regarding a deaf person, a deranged person, and a minor, one who wounds them is liable, but if they wound others, they are not liable.</div>
