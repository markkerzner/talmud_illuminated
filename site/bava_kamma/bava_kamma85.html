<div>
How do we calculate compensation for pain? We assess how much money a person wants to give to have his hand  -that is anyway inscribed to the government for amputation - anesthetized, to avoid the difference between amputation by sword and amputation by potion, presumably painless.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
How do we calculate loss of employment? We view the victim as though he were a watchman of cucumbers, since this is all he can in his current state without a hand. And if you say that the person will earn more when he recovers - that payment is already included in the payment for his hand.</div>
