Any three knowledgeable persons who have mastered related areas of law can form a court to judge ordinary cases of damages. However, unusual cases involving penalties, such as half-damages awarded in the first three instances of goring by an ox, can only be judged by people possessing an uninterrupted chain of ordination since the time of Moses. Therefore, such cases can not be judged today.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Allegory Of Virtue Above The Portraits Of Three Lawyers And A Notary by Domenico Tintoretto (Robusti)</div>
