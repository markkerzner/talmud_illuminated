Any three knowledgeable persons who have mastered related areas of law can form a court to judge ordinary cases of damages.

Therefore, such cases can not be judged today.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Allegory Of Virtue Above The Portraits Of Three Lawyers And A Notary by Domenico Tintoretto (Robusti)</div>
