<br />
If he stole an ox or sheep and then sold it on the Sabbath, or if he then sold it for idolatry, he pays fourfold or fivefold payments. Had he slaughtered on Sabbath - which is a capital offense - he would be exempt from payment, because of the "one is subject only to the greater penalty" rule.<br />
