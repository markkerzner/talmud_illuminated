The owner can't claim that his friend was doing a mitzvah saving his animal.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
If the animal continues eating, the owner pays for not having to feed it next time. Once the animal knows its way to the garden, the owner is liable if he doesn't watch it more closely.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
If the owner was negligent and has to pay full damages in the field, they are estimated as a &nbsp;loss in value of a field sixty times larger, with similar damage.</div>
