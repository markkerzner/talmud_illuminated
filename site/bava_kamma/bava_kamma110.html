<div>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">A convert to Judaism is considered in many aspects a newborn child, not part of his old family, nor yet of any new one.</span></div>
<br />
<div>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">If one robs a convert and swears falsely to him in denial of the robbery, and the convert then dies without leaving heirs, the robber </span><a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/5-8.htm"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">pays the principal and the one-fifth surcharge to the Kohanim, and brings a guilt offering to the Altar</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: x-large;">. </span></div>
<br />
<div>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">If the robber was bringing up the money and the guilt offering to Jerusalem, and he died on route, the money shall be given to the robber's sons, because restitution to the Kohanim is only to atone for his guilt - while alive.</span></div>
