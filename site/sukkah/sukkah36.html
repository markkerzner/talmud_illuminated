<h1>Sukkah 36 - Etrog must be beautiful</h1>
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KvTYu-IFOBA/UyXSv9bns8I/AAAAAAAAQRI/ASVto8dIOaA/s1600/Dormice+By+Archibald+Thorburn.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KvTYu-IFOBA/UyXSv9bns8I/AAAAAAAAQRI/ASVto8dIOaA/s1600/Dormice+By+Archibald+Thorburn.jpg" width="211" /></a>Etrog must be gorgeous since Torah called it the "fruit of a glorious tree." Thus, for example, if it was split or punctured to miss a slight piece, it is invalid. However, if it was punctured with a needle but is complete, it still looks good, and therefore it is valid. 
<br />
<br />
Rava asked a related query: "What if its internal part has rotted away, similar to a rotting lung? Would it be kosher?" On the one hand, the etrog looks good and similar to a lung that has rotten in the internal tissues; it may still be valid. On the other hand, a lung is completely protected from the outside air and thus does not rot further, but an etrog is open to elements and might deteriorate more. The Talmud tries to find proof from the law of a spoiled etrog but discards this attempt because perhaps that spoiling was from the outside, and Rava is asking about the inside. The question thus remains unresolved. 
<br />
<br />
If one grew an etrog in a mold, and now it does not have the regular etrog shape - it is invalid because it is atypical. However, it is valid if he reshaped it, and the new shape is also characteristic of an etrog.
<br />
<br />
If mice punctured an etrog and made a hole in it, it is invalid. But Rav Chanina would dip his etrog, eat a piece, and then use it, and it was still valid!? - A mice bite is different because it is repulsive to people, and this is not beautiful.
