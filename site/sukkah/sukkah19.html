The Sages, however, regard it as one large sloping roof, and it is valid. Some say that the logic is correct, but the attribution is the reverse - Rabbi Eliezer says what the Sages say, and vice versa.

If one wants to use a reed mat to cover his sukkah - a very convenient way, rather than messing with the leaves and branches - will it be a kosher s'chach? - A small mat is made for lying down on it, and it is thus a utensil; since all utensils are susceptible to ritual impurity and therefore cannot be used for the sukkah covering, the small mat is not kosher. However, with large mats, it depends. If it was made originally for lying down, it is a utensil and cannot be used. Still, if it was made for covering the sukkah - then it is not a utensil in the normal sense of the word, does not accept ritual impurity, and therefore is a kosher sukkah covering.
