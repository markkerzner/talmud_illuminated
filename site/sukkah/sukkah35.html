Etrog (citron) is one of the species in the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/03/sukkah-34-branches.html">Sukkot bunch</a>. However, since it is special in that it has taste and smell, its requirements are more strict. For example, the laws of orlah (fruit that is not eaten for the first three years) apply to it, and thus an etrog in the first three years is invalid. Technically, this is because, by law, it will be burned and thus is considered to have zero measurements even now.<br />
<br />
If the etrog is the priest's portion (terumah) and is ritually impure - it is invalid because one cannot eat it. If it is the priest's portion and it is pure - then one should not take it so that he does not make it impure, but if he does - it is valid.
<br />
<br />
But how do we know that "etrog" is citron in the first place? Since the Torah calls it "beautiful tree-fruit," we understand that it comes from such a special tree whose branches also have the taste of its fruit - and that is citron. But perhaps it is pepper? - No, that could not be: if you take just one pepper, it is too small. And if you take two or three - the Torah said to take one fruit, not two or three. Thus it must be citron.
