And who are these? - Those who have what to eat for today and worry about tomorrow. Honesty, authentic learning, and filial piety were gone. On whom are we to rely? Only on God.

When Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa died, there were no more people of good deeds, and after Rabbi Akiva,&nbsp; there were no more supporters of the Torah, and the wells of wisdom were closed. 
<br />
<br />
After Rabbi Yehudah the Prince died, there was no more humility and fear of sin. However, when this teaching was recited in his academy, Rav Yosef corrected the students and told them that there was still genuine humility because he was there. Similarly, Rav Nachman said to take out "no fear of sin" since he was yet alive.<br />
