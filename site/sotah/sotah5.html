Moreover, when someone is haughty, God says, "This world is too small for the two of us," or more precisely, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26a1.htm">One who is haughty and proud - him I cannot bear (says God)</a>".<br />
<br />
And yet, a Sage must have a small measure of haughtiness. How much? One eighth of one  eighth. And for a Sage it is an ornament, like the upper part of a wheat stalk. Rava said, "One who has it is damned and one who does not is damned." But it is better to err on the side of humility.
<br />
<br />
When one prays though, she should definitely be humble. Follow this, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2651.htm">Humble spirit is like God's sacrifices</a>" - which means that a prayer with a humble heart is equal not to a specific one but to all sacrifices together.<br />
