<h1>Nedarim 58 - The question of an onion</h1>

This onion was picked up in a Shmita year, and thus was <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-26-seventh-year-sheviit.html">prohibited to trade</a>, to keep after there were no more such onions in the fields, and so on. However, it was replanted in the next year, experienced significant growth, and now the question is: does this new permitted growth nullify the prohibitions of the base onion, or does the new growth itself have the limitations of the Shmita produce.
<br />
<br />
The reason that Rabbi Ishmael asked about the complete onion and not about just the new growth is this: the answer to this question would automatically give him the answer about the new growth. So he preferred to ask one question that combined the two.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud attempts to find the answer by comparing this to other contemporary or older rulings, but finds differences; for example, in our case the onion does not completely decomposes in the ground, but other rulings may be talking about cases where a seed does decomposes.
<br />
<br />
So far the question is unresolved. The question is unrelated to vows (Nedarim), but it is discussed here because on the next page the Talmud will attempt to derive a proof from an a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2015/07/nedarim-57-i-am-not-eating-this-fruit.html">law of vows we just learned</a>.
