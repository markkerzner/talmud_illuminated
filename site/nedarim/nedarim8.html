Let us see some more of Rav Gidel's advice.
<br />
<br />
It is commendable to take an oath to do a mitzvah. Even though one is already under oath to do mitzvot, since the Jewish people have accepted this oath as a whole, it is still OK to do more. We learn it from King David, who said, "I swore, and I will perform Your righteous mitzvot."
<br />
<br />
He also said that one who saw in a dream himself being excommunicated should find ten scholars to lift the ban from him. These should be people able to reason, not just retell the laws. But if one can't find such scholars, those who know the law will also do. And if one cannot find even these, he should sit on the crossroad and greet every person with "Peace be unto you." After ten passersby return his greeting with "Peace unto you," his ban is lifted.<br />
