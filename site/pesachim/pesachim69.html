This other offering is called "chagigah," or the festival offering.&nbsp;<p></p><p>However, this chagigah had more conditions attached to it than the Passover offering. The chagigah was brought only on the Passover that fell on a weekday, not on Shabbat. Chagigah was also not brought when there was enough of the Passover lamb anyway, such as few invitees in the group.</p><p>The chagigah could be a sheep, a cow, a goat, male or female, and, unlike Passover, it could be eaten for two days and one night.</p><p>Art: Landscape with a Goat and Sheep by Philipp Peter Roos</p><div><br /></div>
