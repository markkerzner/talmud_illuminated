What follows for the next seven pages is a discussion of this rule's ramifications, and this chapter is considered one of the hardest in the Talmud.
<br />
<br />
The subjects that will be discussed include sources of ritual impurity (humans and animals), degrees of impurity (there are five of them), objects that can become impure (humans but not animals, also vessels, clothing, food, and beverages), purification from impurity (mikveh), and consequences of impurity (none today, all were important only in the times of the Temple).
