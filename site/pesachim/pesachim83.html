Take, for example, the bones. "<a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=12#P1863" target="_blank">Do not break any of its bones</a>," said the Torah. Therefore, the marrow inside the bones cannot be removed." But any edible part of a sacrifice becomes <i>notar</i>, or leftover, on the next day and has to be burned. So leftover bones must be burned.<p></p><p>The same is true for the sinews and leftover meat of the sacrifice. They all must be burned on the next day after the Seder. If that day fell out on Shabbat, they wait till yet the next day. Although it is a mitzvah, the burning of the leftover does not override either Shabbat or the Holiday.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;Still Life with a Goat Head&nbsp; Jusepe de Ribera</p>
