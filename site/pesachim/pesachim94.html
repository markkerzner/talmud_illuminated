A person walks forty <i>mil</i>&nbsp;a day. From here, we can calculate many other distances.<p></p><p>For example, Egypt is four hundred <i>parsah</i> by four hundred <i>parsah</i> (where <i>parsah</i> is eight thousand square amah), Kush is sixty times larger, the world is sixty times larger than Kush, and Eden is sixty times larger than the world.</p><p>What do all these numbers mean, and why do they matter? They are hints to spiritual journeys. For example, when earlier we learned about a one who was impure on the first Pesach, it is a hint that he made his soul impure on his first reincarnation.&nbsp;Now he needs to come back again (this is his second Pesach). For a righteous person, mistakes in learning are considered intentional errors. However, he is <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2021/02/pesachim-93.html" target="_blank">free from punishment</a> if he fails to bring his Passover offering. The more one learns the more one understands these hints.</p><p>Art:&nbsp;A Scholar in His Study by Salomon Koninck</p>
