<h1>Temurah 17 - Sometimes Exchanges Are More Stringent Than Sacrifices, And Sometimes Less</h1>
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V2c3mVKbsEM/T1L61VdDjPI/AAAAAAAAItc/1VR3boEiOgI/s1600/Bela+Pallik+-+Ewes+grazing.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="236" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-V2c3mVKbsEM/T1L61VdDjPI/AAAAAAAAItc/1VR3boEiOgI/s320/Bela+Pallik+-+Ewes+grazing.jpg" width="320" /></a>Sacrifices are more stringent than their exchanges: a sacrifice can be used to create an exchange, but an exchange cannot be used to create another exchange; partners can consecrate an animal to be a sacrifice, but not to make an exchange; fetuses and limbs can be consecrated, as part of a live animal, but one cannot make an exchange of them.
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, although it is completely impossible to consecrate a blemished animal, one can exchange a blemished animal for a sacrifice, and this exchange will work. In that way, one can create a blemished sacrifice, and in this exchanges are more stringent than regular sacrifices.
<br />
<br />
And in this sacrifices and exchanges are the same: the offspring of a peace offering and its exchange&nbsp;are peace offerings; so are&nbsp;their offspring, and the offspring of their offspring, until the end of time, with all the accompanying details. That is because peace offerings can be females, unlike, for example,&nbsp;burned&nbsp;offerings. Why did "end of time" have to be mentioned? - To disprove Rabbi Eliezer, who says on the next page that an offspring of a peace offering cannot be brought on the Altar.<br />
