<h1>Temurah 30 - The Wage Of A Dog</h1>

However, a wage of a dog and an exchange of a harlot are permitted. But why? Why not include those categories also? - Because the Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=23#P5513">they both</a>&nbsp;are displeasing to God," which means that only two are prohibited, not three or four. What is a wage of a dog? When one says, "Take this lamb as payment for letting me spend the night with your dog."
<br />
<br />
If one gave a harlot coins as her wage, she can use them to buy a sacrifice - since only the actual item received as payment is prohibited as a sacrifice. However, if he gave her wine, oil, or flour, which can normally be brought in the Temple, these become prohibited. 
<br />
<br />
As we learned, animals that were worshipped or sodomized are prohibited for the Altar. However, their offspring are permitted. That is true only if they were first sodomized - which made them prohibited - and then they conceived, and the offspring is a mixture of the prohibited mother and permitted animal father. If they first conceived and then were sodomized, then Rabbi Eliezer says that the offspring are also prohibited, because it is considered as part of the mother, and was as if sodomized with the mother.
