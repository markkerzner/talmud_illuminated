By contrast, Temple consecrations are used for all other Temple needs, such as repairs. Each category is in some ways more special than the other.
<br />
<br />
Altar consecrations can be used to make a (forbidden) sacrifice exchange; the intention to eat them beyond allotted time, actually leaving them over, or eating them while impure makes one liable to punishment; even if they are redeemed, their offspring and milk are still prohibited; one who slaughters them outside the Temple is liable; they cannot be given to craftsmen working in the Temple as their fee. All of these are not true for Temple consecration.
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Temple consecrations are special, because if a person consecrates something without specifying if he meant for the Altar or for the Temple, it becomes consecrated for the Temple. What grows from them is prohibited for use, and one commits misappropriation if he uses it. What is it? For example, eggs of a hen, or milk of a she-donkey. Finally, the Kohanim get no benefit from Temple consecrations, but they do receive a hide or a portion of meat from Altar consecrations.
