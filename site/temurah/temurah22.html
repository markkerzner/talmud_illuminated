<h1>Temurah 22 - Child Of A Sin Offering</h1>

Now we can explain those cases.
<br />
<br />
A child of a sin offering cannot atone for any sin, since it was not consecrated for that purpose. It is nevertheless consecrated as a sacrifice, and, lacking a purpose, represents one of these cases. Was the animal already pregnant when consecrated, or did it conceive after being consecrated - that is a subject of an <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/02/temurah-11-sanctifying-fetus-of-animal.html">earlier disagreement between Rabbi Yochanan and Bar Padda</a>.
<br />
<br />
An exchange of a sin offering becomes consecrated. However, it cannot be offered as a sin offering, since consecrating the exchange it itself a sin.
<br />
<br />
A sin offering whose owner died is also left to die. Normally, a sacrifice is brought by the heirs of the deceased. However, a sin offering is no longer needed, since death itself serves as an atonement for one's sins.
<br />
<br />
A sin offering that has grown older than a year, or one that was lost and later found blemished, has a hope: if the owner already atoned for their sins with a different offering, it is left to die, but if he rather wanted to replace his defective sin offering with a valid one, then it is left to graze and sold when it gets a blemish, and the money is used for another sacrifice.
