</div><span style="font-size: medium;">One who owns a water cistern within the house of his fellow (he either inherited it or bought it along with rights of access) may enter to draw water only at the time when people usually enter, that is, during the day. He may not bring his animal and give it to drink directly from the pit, but he must fill a container and give the animal to drink outside.<br />
<br />
The pit owner makes a lock for the cistern, and the homeowner makes his lock. The owner of the cistern – so that the homeowner would not rob him of his water. The homeowner – to avoid suspicions of impropriety concerning his wife.</span><br />
