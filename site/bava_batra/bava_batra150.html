</div><span style="font-size: medium;">These categories of people are treated differently depending on whether they give away all or only some of their possessions.<br />
<br />
* A seriously ill person – his gift (in case he recovers) is valid only if he distributed all that he had;<br />
* A person's gift to his slave – the slave goes free, but only if he gets all of his master's possessions, for otherwise the master may have kept the slave and with him the gift that he gave;<br />
* If a man gives everything to his wife, he has only appointed her an administrator over his estate;<br />
* A woman who sequesters her possessions by giving them to a third party when she gets married, to keep them out of reach of her husband – if she gives all, she can get them back, for otherwise it is a regular gift.<br />
