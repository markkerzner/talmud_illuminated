<h1>Bava Batra 57 -  Activities that Establish Presumption of Ownership</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/Stqee74x10I/AAAAAAAACsw/TnNNTQKUl8I/s1600-h/Alexandre+Defaux+-+Feeding+the+Chickens.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/Stqee74x10I/AAAAAAAACsw/TnNNTQKUl8I/s320/Alexandre+Defaux+-+Feeding+the+Chickens.jpg" /></a><br />
</div><span style="font-size: medium;">These activities do not establish chazakah: if a person would place an animal in a courtyard belonging to someone else; if he would place an oven, millstones, or a stove in the courtyard; if he would raise a chicken or deposit his manure there. The property owner can claim that he saw no harm in allowing these items to remain.<br />
<br />
But if the user made a partition for his animals ten hand-breadths high, or he erected such a partition for an oven, stove or millstone; if he brought his chicken into the owner's house, or if he made for his manure in the courtyard a place either three hand-breadths deep or three hand-breadths high - this is a chazakah. If the owner did not protest these uses of his property for three years, it supports the user's claim that he acquired the right to use the purposes for those purposes.<br />
