</div><span style="font-size: medium;">Both a son and a daughter (where there are no sons) are equal with respect to inheriting from a mother's estate and a father's estate. However, there are some differences.<br />
<br />
A son who is a firstborn takes a double portion of his father's estate, but he does not take a double portion of his mother's estate - since "...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">to him is the right of the firstborn</a>" can be understood to say that "regarding him, that is, the father, the right of the firstborn applies."<br />
<br />
The daughters are supported from the father's estate until they marry, but they are not supported from the mother's estate.<br />
