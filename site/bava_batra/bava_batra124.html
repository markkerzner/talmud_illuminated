<h1>Bava Batra 124 – Limitations to the Double Portion of the Firstborn</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/SzKfP2wX8JI/AAAAAAAADCs/Py55OKK1HEE/s1600-h/George+W.+Horlor+-+Cattle,+Sheep+and+Rabbits+on+a+hillside.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/SzKfP2wX8JI/AAAAAAAADCs/Py55OKK1HEE/s320/George+W.+Horlor+-+Cattle,+Sheep+and+Rabbits+on+a+hillside.jpg" /></a><br />
</div><span style="font-size: medium;">What is the status of the benefits that accrue to the father's estate after his death but before the division, such as a calf born of a cow in the estate, or a loan repaid to the estate?<br />
<br />
<i>Rabbis</i>: the firstborn does not take the double portion of that;<br />
<i>Rebbi</i>: the firstborn takes a double portion of those benefits that happen automatically, but not those that the orphans brought to the estate through their actions.<br />
<br />
What are their arguments?<br />
<br />
<i>Rabbis</i>: the expression “...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">to give him the double portion</a>...” compares the double portion to a gift. Just as a gift cannot be given unless it has come into the donor's possession, so does the double portion include only present assets.<br />
<br />
<i>Rebbi</i>: the words “...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">double portion</a>...” make the law for both portions the same, to include future automatic benefits.<br />
