<h1>Bava Batra 116 - Man Who Leaves Not a Son</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/SyfUbPvgiUI/AAAAAAAADAk/C7YdfoBD7dA/s1600-h/John+Frederick+Lewis+-+A+Turkish+School+in+the+Vicinity+of+Cairo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/SyfUbPvgiUI/AAAAAAAADAk/C7YdfoBD7dA/s320/John+Frederick+Lewis+-+A+Turkish+School+in+the+Vicinity+of+Cairo.jpg" /></a><br />
</div><span style="font-size: medium;">R. Yochanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai, "Whoever does not leave behind a son to inherit him, the Holy One, Blessed be He is full of anger toward him." <br />
<br />
From where do we know this? "...<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/27-8.htm">If a man dies and he has no son, and you will pass (veha'avartem) his inheritance</a>..."  and "evrah" means a day of anger, as in "...<a href="http://bible.cc/zephaniah/1-15.htm">a day of anger</a>..." <br />
<br />
But is it a son or a student? Since Rabbi Yochanan lost his ten sons and would console people with "...look, this is a bone of my last son..." - it must be that he meant a student, for otherwise he would not publicize that God is angry with him. Then why did he say "son?" - These were the words of his teacher, but he himself felt that a man must leave a student.<br />
