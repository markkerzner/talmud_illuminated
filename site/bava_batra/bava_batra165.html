<h1>Bava Batra 165 - Three Daily Transgressions</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S2hj_CJl6yI/AAAAAAAADO0/PgrLxLgkbnM/s1600-h/Louis+Charles+Moeller+-+The+gossips.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S2hj_CJl6yI/AAAAAAAADO0/PgrLxLgkbnM/s320/Louis+Charles+Moeller+-+The+gossips.jpg" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">Said Rav: "From three transgressions no man is saved each day: thoughts of sin, lack of concentration in prayer, and speaking negatively about others." Did Rav really mean that everybody engages in negative speech daily? Rather, he meant a hint of negative speech by using body language and voice inflection.<br />
<br />
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said, "In a place where both open and bound documents are used, if one instructs to write an open one, but the scribe wrote a bound one, it is acceptable, because he only said it by way of example."<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai also subscribes to the "by way of example" idea, as in <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/11/kiddushin-49-betrothal-with-wrong.html">the case of a woman who appointed an agent to accept her betrothal money of a silver dinar, but the agent accepted a gold dinar</a>. She mentioned the silver dinar only by way of example, and she is betrothed with a golden dinar.<br />
