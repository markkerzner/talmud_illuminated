<h1>Bava Batra 164 - Dating a Bound Document</h1>

<br />
Rebbi offered a rebuttal: the dating system on the two types of document is different. Jews dated their documents by the year of rule of the current monarch. Governments used to add a year to the number of years of the current king, to proclaim that  a relatively new monarch is already established. The Sages, desiring to make a bound document very complex, also added a year for bound documents, but not for regular ones. One could unbind the document, effectively changing the loan date, receive the payment, pretend to have lost the loan document, offer a receipt, and then collect the second time.<br />
<br />
But according to Rabbi Chanina, a receipt is never used.<br />
