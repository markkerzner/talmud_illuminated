</div><span style="font-size: medium;">In the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/10/bava-batra-64-does-seller-sell-with.html">discussion about the seller's attitude being generous or stingy</a>, the law follows Rabbi Nachman, who said that the seller sells generously. Rav Nachman was close to the Exilarch, the Jewish ruler of Babylonia, and observed many judges and court cases, so he knew which view was followed in practice.<br />
<br />
One who sold a house without specifying what was included in the sale has sold the attached mortar, not the movable mortar, nor the movable oven or stove. If the seller said, "I am selling the house and all contained therein," all movable objects are sold - but not the easily movable objects (carried away). Even easily movable objects are sold if one sells a courtyard with everything therein. If one sells a town, even his animals therein are included.<br />
