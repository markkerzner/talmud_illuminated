In the case of two partners who agreed to make a partition in their jointly owned courtyard, the "partition" is  understood as division, not a wall.<br /><br />Now the case reads as follows. Once they agreed to divide the yard, even though they did not stipulate to build the wall, they must build a stone wall, against the objections of either party. This is true even if they have not agreed to divide, since any one of them can separate at will. However, the previous ruling  deals with a very small yard of less than 8 by 4 amot (about 16 by 8 feet), which is not divisible, unless they agree to divide it.</span>
