</div><span style="font-size: medium;">A <i>beit kor</i> is a tract of land on which a kor of barley seed can be sown. It is fixed at 75,000 square amot, or between 4 to 7Â½ acres.<br />
<br />
If one says to his fellow, "I am selling you a <i>beit kor</i> of earth - that is, land suitable for cultivation - and there were clefts 10 hand-breadths or more in depth, or rock 10 hand-breadths high, their are is not included while measuring the area of the sold land. Instead, the seller must provide land of level ground, to the full measure of <i>beit kor</i>. Clefts smaller than 10 hand-breadths, however, do contribute to the total area.<br />
<br />
If the seller said, "I am selling you about a <i>beit kor</i>," then even clefts larger than 10 hand-breadths count as part of the area, because "about" means in whatever condition it is.</span><br />
