<h1>Bava Batra 52 - Two Meanings of Chazakah</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/StP_WytBmXI/AAAAAAAACrM/vs_1MZA6ef0/s1600-h/Winslow+Homer+-+Children+On+A+Fence.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/StP_WytBmXI/AAAAAAAACrM/vs_1MZA6ef0/s320/Winslow+Homer+-+Children+On+A+Fence.jpg" /></a><br />
</div><span style="font-size: medium;">The chazakah, or presumption of ownership, discussed so far, had a challenge against it. For example, a case where a seller, that is, the previous owner claims "I did not sell the land," and the purchaser, that is, the occupant, claims, "I purchased it" - this is the chazakah of proving title, which requires three years to take effect.<br />
<br />
But regarding a chazakah against which there is no challenge, for example, one who gives a gift, or two brothers who divide an estate - where the purpose of chazakah is merely to acquire the property in question - if one locked, fenced, or breached the property even to a minor extent - this is considered chazakah.<br />
