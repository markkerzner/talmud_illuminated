In addition, there must be four amot in front of each one's door, for unloading animals.<br /><br />The general rule is that anything that retains its name after division (such as a cloak if, after division, it becomes two small cloaks and not two pieces of a garment) may be forcibly divided. However, partners may not divide scrolls of the Holy Scriptures, even if both agree, since cutting them in court would be disgraceful.</span><div><span style="font-size: 130%;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 130%;">Art: Carrying the Scrolls of the Law by Simeon Solomon</span></div>
