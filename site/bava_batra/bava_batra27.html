<span style="font-size: medium;">Ulla said: "A tree that is within sixteen amot (~30 feet) of a boundary is a 'thief,' because it draws nutrients illegally from a neighboring field." One does not bring first-fruit from it&nbsp; - because it should be "...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/26-2.htm">from your field</a>..." and because stolen produce in unfit for Temple service.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: medium;">Question against Ulla: Rabbi Akiva said, "Even a minute measure of land is <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/02/discovery-how-i-was-cause-of-my-own.html">subject to the requirements</a> of <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/08/daf-in-100-words-gittin-48.html">first-fruit</a>, and it is <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/08/daf-in-100-words-gittin-36.html">fit to write prosbul on its account</a>.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: medium;">Ulla answers: "Rabbi Akiva is talking about wheat, not a tree." Only wheat can grow on a minute measure of land.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: medium;">However, one of Yehoshua's conditions when dividing Israel was that the practice of planting trees near the border should be tolerated by neighbors, thus making the first-fruit fit.</span>
