Oxen had to be rented for a full day, even if needed for only part of the day. Thus, renting them for less than a full day's work was unprofitable.<br /><br />After the Temple was destroyed, prophecy was taken from the prophets and given to young children.</span><div><span style="font-size: 130%;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 130%;">Art: A Mother and Children by the Window at Duck by Viggo Christian Frederick Pedersen</span></div>
