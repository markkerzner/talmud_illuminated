<span style="font-size: medium;">From where do we derive that the son precedes the daughter in the line of inheritance? From "...<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/27-8.htm">if a man dies... and he has no son, then you shall pass his estate to his daughter</a>..." This implies that the reason the daughter would inherit is because the deceased has no son; but if he had a son, the son would precede her.<br />
<br />
Brothers inherit from each other and bequeath to each other - provided that they are brothers from the same father. Brothers related only through their mother are not connected for inheritance. This is derived from "...<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/1-2.htm">according to their families, according to their fathers' households</a>..." <br />
