<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/Ss9ehqx1n8I/AAAAAAAACqU/oZ6vaQbuzvU/s1600-h/+Sandor+Liezen-Mayer+-+Queen+Elisabeth+Signs+The+Condemnation+To+Death+To+Mary+Stuart+-+1879.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/Ss9ehqx1n8I/AAAAAAAACqU/oZ6vaQbuzvU/s320/+Sandor+Liezen-Mayer+-+Queen+Elisabeth+Signs+The+Condemnation+To+Death+To+Mary+Stuart+-+1879.jpg" /></a><br />
</div><span style="font-size: medium;">Tabbi distressed Pappi until he relented and sold him what he demanded. Rabbah bar bar Chanah signed two documents: notification that the sale was executed under duress, as well as the document of sale<br />
<br />
Said Rav Huna: both documents have legal force. But how can it be? Rather, what Rav Huna meant is that the forced sale would be valid, if not canceled by the prior notification – since it was Rav Huna who introduced <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/10/bava-batra-48-is-forced-action-valid.html">the forced sale rule</a>.<br />
<br />
But we have a <a href="http://www.poetry-chaikhana.com/K/KhayyamOmar/51MovingFing.htm">rule that a witness, having testified, can't offer a new testimony contradicting his first one</a>. How could Rabbah sign on both documents? - Exactly! Since he signed on the notification of duress first, his signature on the document of sale becomes invalid.</span>
