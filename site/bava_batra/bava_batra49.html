</div><span style="font-size: medium;">Tabbi distressed Pappi until he relented and sold him what he demanded. Rabbah bar bar Chanah signed two documents: notification that the sale was executed under duress, as well as the document of sale<br />
<br />
Said Rav Huna: both documents have legal force. But how can it be? Rather, what Rav Huna meant is that the forced sale would be valid, if not canceled by the prior notification - since it was Rav Huna who introduced <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/10/bava-batra-48-is-forced-action-valid.html">the forced sale rule</a>.<br />
<br />
But we have a <a href="http://www.poetry-chaikhana.com/K/KhayyamOmar/51MovingFing.htm">rule that a witness, having testified, can't offer a new testimony contradicting his first one</a>. How could Rabbah sign on both documents? - Exactly! Since he signed on the notification of duress first, his signature on the document of sale becomes invalid.</span>
