</div><span style="font-size: medium;">One may not open his windows into a jointly owned courtyard, since he will be able to observe the activities of his partners in the courtyard below without their knowledge, thereby committing visual trespass. <br />
<br />
The person opening the window could argue to his partner: "In any event you need to conceal your actions in the courtyard from me, and windows will not result in any additional visual trespass."<br />
<br />
However, his partner can reply, "When you were in your house and your door was closed, I was able to use the courtyard for private activities. But now, if you open a window to the courtyard, even when you are in your home, I need to conceal myself from you."<br />
