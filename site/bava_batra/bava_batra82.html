</div><span style="font-size: medium;">When one buys trees, the question of <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/11/bava-batra-81-buying-trees.html">whether he owns the land under them</a>&nbsp; is important for bringing <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/09/bava-batra-27-first-fruit-must-be-from.html">first fruit from these trees</a>. <br />
<br />
If he owns the land, he also recites&nbsp;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/26-3.htm">the prescribed verses</a>, thanking God for the Land that He has given him. If he does not own the land, he brings the first fruit, but cannot recite the verses. Why not? One should be allowed to recite Torah verses!&nbsp; - Either because his words "...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/26-3.htm">the Land that You gave me</a>..." will have the appearance of falsehood, or because he may regard his fruit as definite first fruit, and because of that neglect his tithe obligations.<br />
