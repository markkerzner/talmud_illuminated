<h1>Bava Batra 79 - Selling a Donkey and its Foal</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/Svb72CJCcCI/AAAAAAAAC04/q4SwV-_9NEk/s1600-h/Sergei+Ivanovich+Svetoslavsky+-+A+Spring+Day,+or+Beehives,+1899.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/Svb72CJCcCI/AAAAAAAAC04/q4SwV-_9NEk/s320/Sergei+Ivanovich+Svetoslavsky+-+A+Spring+Day,+or+Beehives,+1899.jpg" /></a><br />
</div><span style="font-size: medium;">One who sells a donkey has sold its foal, but if one sold a cow, he has not sold its calf. If one sold a dump, he has sold its manure. If one sold a pit, he has sold its waters. If one sold a beehive, he has sold the bees. If one sold a dovecote, he has sold the doves. In all these cases, the contents are considered subsidiary to and are sold along with the primary item that contains them.<br />
<br />
Why is a donkey different from a cow? In this case, he said, "I am selling you a nursing donkey." For the cow, this may be interpreted as buying the cow for its milk, but the non-kosher milk of a donkey is useless to the buyer, and therefore the "nursing" adds its foal to the sale.</span>
