<h1>Bava Batra 34 - The Case of the Silver Ingot of Rav Abba</h1>
<span style="font-size: large;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/SrusGKrgdQI/AAAAAAAACmg/HL992jWJfjw/s1600-h/Karl+Witkowski+-+Stealing+Apples.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/SrusGKrgdQI/AAAAAAAACmg/HL992jWJfjw/s320/Karl+Witkowski+-+Stealing+Apples.jpg" /></a></span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;">A certain man snatched a silver ingot from his fellow. There was one witness to the snatching, but the defendant said, "Yes, I snatched it, but it was my ingot that I snatched!"<br />
</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> <br />
Rabbi Ami considered the case:<br />
<br />
* Should he be required to pay? But there aren't two witnesses!<br />
* Exempt him based on "Why would he lie?" -&nbsp; he could deny having snatched it altogether? This argument is weakened by the witness.<br />
* Make him swear that he did not snatch it? But he himself admits that he did!<br />
* Make him swear that the ingot was his? We can't concoct oaths!<br />
<br />
Rav Abba offered a solution. The snatcher is obligated to take an oath but can not do so, and all such people must pay.<br />
