<br />
If one sells a house, without specifying what is included in the sale, he has not sold the annex, even it is opens into the house, nor has he sold a storeroom in the rear of the house (such storeroom served as a storage area for valuables and did not function&nbsp; as part of the living area of the house), nor has he sold the rooftop if it has a parapet around it at least ten hand-breads high.</span>
