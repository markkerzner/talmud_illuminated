<span style="font-size: medium;">A tradesman who resides outside of a town where his type of business has already been established can be barred from plying his trade in that town.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: medium;">Rav Dimi, a Sage, brought his figs to a town that wanted to give him exclusive trading rights. They sent Rav Adda bar Abba to test him. He asked, "If an elephant swallows a willow-reed basket and then ejects it through its rectum, is it susceptible to ritual impurity, or is it like manure? Rav Dimi didn't know, so Rav Adda patronized him. Rav Dimi's figs spoiled, and Rav Adda died. Every Sage involved took the blame for Rav Adda's death on himself - because they wanted to discharge their karmic debt.</span><br />
