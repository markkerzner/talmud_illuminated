<h1>Bava Batra 140 - Doubtful Gender Takes the Lesser Portion in the Inheritance</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S0ddi2L_KOI/AAAAAAAADHc/xXB_5Z2lH-w/s1600-h/Michelangelo+Merisi+da+Caravaggio+-+Narcissus.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S0ddi2L_KOI/AAAAAAAADHc/xXB_5Z2lH-w/s320/Michelangelo+Merisi+da+Caravaggio+-+Narcissus.jpg" /></a><br />
</div><span style="font-size: medium;">If the deceased left behind sons and daughters and a tumtum (a person of indeterminate gender, with genitals recessed and covered by flesh) - when the property is abundant, the males push the tumtum away to the females. Since it is unknown whether the tumtum is male or female,&nbsp; he cannot claim more than the lesser of the two portions. He thus receives support until maturity, like the daughters. When the property is&nbsp; meager, the females push him away to the males, and he receives nothing, like the other sons.</span><br />
