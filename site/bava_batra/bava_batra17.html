<span style="font-size: medium;">Rabbi Meir: "If Abraham had a daughter, he would not want her to marry in Canaan, and he would not want her to go away, for everywhere they served idols. He did not have a daughter, and in his case it was a blessing." Rabbi Yehudah: "He did have a daughter, and her name was 'Everything' (bakol)."</span><br />

<span style="font-size: medium;">To prevent damage to a neighbor's pit, one may not dig in his own property near it a pit, ditch, vault, irrigation channel, or laundering pool - unless he distances it at least three hand-breadths from his neighbor's pit and apply lime to the walls of his pit.</span><br />

<span style="font-size: medium;">Olive press refuse, manure, salt, lime, and flint stones must be distanced at least three hand-breadths from the brick wall of one's neighbor, or one must apply lime to the wall.</span>
