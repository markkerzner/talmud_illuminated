<h1>Bava Batra 85 - One's Container Formalizes Acquisition</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/Sv-neWEmfHI/AAAAAAAAC2w/D5Q07yTMJ40/s1600-h/Gustave+Courbet+-+The+Grain+Sifters.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/Sv-neWEmfHI/AAAAAAAAC2w/D5Q07yTMJ40/s320/Gustave+Courbet+-+The+Grain+Sifters.jpg" /></a><br />
</div><span style="font-size: medium;">Rav and Shmuel both said, "A person's container can formalize acquisition for him in any place - except in the public domain." Rabbi Yochanan and Resh Lakish both said, "Even in the public domain."<br />
<br />
A person's </span><span style="font-size: medium;">container</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> can act as his courtyard to acquire items that are placed in it, provided that the </span><span style="font-size: medium;">container</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> is placed in a domain where the </span><span style="font-size: medium;">container</span><span style="font-size: medium;">'s owner has the right to place it. Thus a buyer can acquire items in the seller's domain by placing them in his </span><span style="font-size: medium;">container</span><span style="font-size: medium;">, provided that the seller gives him the right to place the </span><span style="font-size: medium;">container</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> there. One can place </span><span style="font-size: medium;">containers</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> in the public domain also - but not keep them there permanently.<br />
<br />
However, they don't argue. The first ruling is dealing with a public thoroughfare, and the second - with the quiet recessed area of the public domain, to which people step to discuss business.<br />
