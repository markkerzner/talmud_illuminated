If two loan documents were from a single borrower, the larger one is considered paid.<br />
<br />
One who lends money to his fellow on the basis of a guarantor may not collect first from the guarantor. However, if the lender said to the guarantor at the time of the loan, “I am making this loan on the condition that I should be able to collect from whomever I wish” - then he may indeed collect from the guarantor. <br />
