<h1>Bava Batra 63 - No Unnecessary Terms in Legal Documents</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/SuHdOiYYusI/AAAAAAAACvY/ZSQMIZKB8Jw/s1600-h/Constantin+Hansen+-+View+over+Roman+Rooftops+-+Udsigt+over+Roms+tage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/SuHdOiYYusI/AAAAAAAACvY/ZSQMIZKB8Jw/s320/Constantin+Hansen+-+View+over+Roman+Rooftops+-+Udsigt+over+Roms+tage.jpg" /></a><br />
</div><span style="font-size: medium;">If an ineffectual clause appears in a legal document, it is reinterpreted in such a way that it is effectual.<br />
<br />
For example, if one sells a house to his fellow and says to him, "I am selling you this house with the stipulation that the fenced rooftop is mine" - the fenced rooftop is his. The clause "rooftop is mine" is redundant. It is already his, as <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/10/bava-batra-60-when-one-buys-house.html">we have learned before</a>. Therefore, this clause is reinterpreted to give him additional rights.<br />
<br />
Exactly which rights he gets is subject to a dispute: either that he may project beams from the roof into the adjacent yard, or that he may rebuild it if it collapses, with the second view prevailing.<br />
