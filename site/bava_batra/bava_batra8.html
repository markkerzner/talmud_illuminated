However, he said that only the students of the Torah may enter and take food, but not unlearned folk, since he held that misfortunes come to the world only because of the unlearned people.<br /><br />His disciple, Rabbi Yonatan ben Amram, disguised himself and pushed his way in:<br /><br />- Master, please sustain me.<br />- My son, are you a student of the Torah or related areas?<br />- No.<br />- If so, on what merit shall I sustain you?<br />- Sustain me as you would a dog or  a raven.<br /><br />Rabbi Yehudah relented but later became distressed.
