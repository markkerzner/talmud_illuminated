<br />
Since all of Yom Kippur's services will be done by him, and they are kosher only if performed by a High Priest, this additional measure of separation was required to prevent even an unlikely possibility of him becoming ritually impure for the service.<br />
<br />
There was yet another event in the life of a High Priest when a seven-day separation was required, and that was before burning of the Red Heifer to provide ashes for the purification from a dead body. Both had their source in the Torah and were connected to the Levites' initial consecration for the services, when they likewise <a href="https://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=8#P2948" target="_blank">spent seven days near the Tabernacle, separated from the rest</a>. Back then, the Levites did it "to do" "atonement." For the future, "to do" refers to the Red Heifer and "atonement" to Yom Kippur.<br />
