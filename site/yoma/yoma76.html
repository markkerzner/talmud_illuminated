A king had a son, and he gave him his allowance once for the whole year. Consequently, his son visited him only once a year. The king then changed to giving him money daily, and now the son visited him every day. So too the Jews: one who had four or five children would worry, thinking, perhaps the manna will not fall tomorrow, and they will die of starvation. Thus, the Israelites now directed their hearts to God at all times.” Others say so that it would be warm and fresh. Yet others - so that they did not have to carry it.

Earlier, we mentioned the five things that one is should abstain from on Yom Kippur: <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/01/yoma-74-how-to-properly-afflict-oneself.html">food, drink, washing</a>, etc. Where does it say so in the Torah? - It could be that it is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah, but because the term “deprivation” is mentioned five times, the Sages decreed five deprivations that one should sustain. Food, however, is named explicitly, and drinking is included together with eating. How do we know this last fact? - Because Torah mentioned drinking wine and put it in the list of food items.
<br />
<br />
Incidentally, wine makes one wise, and excessive drinking leads to poverty. This is reflected in the word “tirosh” used for wine. If one deserves, it makes him “rosh” - head; if not - it makes him “rash” - poor.
