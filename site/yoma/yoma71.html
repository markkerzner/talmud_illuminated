He again washes his hands and feet before removing his white linen vestments, undresses, descends, immerses, ascends, and dries himself. This is his fifth and final immersion of the day. They bring him the golden vestments, he dresses and sanctifies his hands and feet. Then he enters the Sanctuary to burn the afternoon incense and to lights the lamps of the Menorah.</div>
<br />
He exits, sanctifies his hands and feet before removing his golden vestments, then undresses. They bring him his personal clothing, and he puts them on. They would escort him to his house, and he makes a feast for his friends upon exiting the Sanctuary safely. If he deliberately performed any part of the service improperly, he was liable with his life, and thus emerging unscathed was a cause for celebration. 
<br />
<br />
The regular vestments of a Kohen consisted of four items: a tunic, breeches, a turban, and a belt. The High Priest had eight, adding the breastplate, the "ephod" (apron), the golden plate worn on the forehead. When they needed to know God's advice by consulting Urim VeTumim, these vestments were required.
