Thus, a ram was offered by eleven and a bull - by twenty-four priests. Each carried his own part of the animal; for the larger parts, more than one priest was required, and the flour offering, which consisted of three "hin" measures (about 3 liters each), each Kohen was bringing a "hin" in its own vessel. This was only done for communal offerings, for added honor, but for a private offering, if its owner designated one Kohen, this Kohen could bring the whole thing. For flaying and cutting up the sacrifices into parts - everybody was equal in that respect.
<br />
<br />
By "everybody was equal," the teacher really means that even a non-Kohen was allowed to do the flaying and the cutting. But how do we know this? - Since the Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=1#P2749">He shall have the burned offering skinned and cut into pieces. Aharon's sons shall place the fire on the Altar</a>..." we understand that starting from the fire service, a Kohen is required, but before that - he is not. 
<br />
<br />
In a similar vein, although normally a non-Kohen who performs priestly service is liable to death at the hands of Heaven, slaughtering is an exception and can be done by a regular Jew. Since the Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=1#P2748">He shall have the young bull slaughtered... and the sons of Aharon will bring its blood to the Altar</a>," we see that beginning from the blood service, a Kohen is required. Still, that slaughter can be done by anybody - usually the owner of the sacrifice.
