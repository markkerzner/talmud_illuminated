<br />
The following are executed by strangulation: one who strikes his father or his mother and inflicts a wound; one who kidnaps a Jewish person, works him, then sells him as a slave; a sage who rebels against the word of the High Court; a false prophet; one who prophesies in the name of a false god; one who commits adultery; false witnesses against a daughter of a Kohen; and a man who illicitly cohabited with the daughter of a Kohen.<br />
<br />
Even though the witnesses have tried to impose the punishment of burning on the daughter of a Kohen, when they are disqualified as false  witnesses, they receive the punishment appropriate for the adulterer, and not the adulteress, because of "...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/19-19.htm">as he conspired to do to his brother</a>."<br />
