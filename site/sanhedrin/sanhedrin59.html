This is true for any day, even Monday. <br />
<br />
Rabbi Yochanan said that an idolater who engrosses himself in Torah study is liable to death, as it says "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=33">Moses commanded us the Torah; it is an inheritance</a>..." But did not Rabbi Meir say that he is rather like a High Priest, because it says about that laws of the Torah "...<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=18">That a man should keep them and live by them</a>." - any man, even an idolater? - This refers to the seven Noahide laws.<br />
<br />
Adam, the first man, was commanded to subsist on vegetation, "...<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=1">it shall be yours for food</a>..." If so, why was he given dominion over animals? Only for work. For fish? Only for work. But can fish do work? - Yes, since it is prohibited to use a combination of fish and goat for pulling a wagon. Why was he then specifically prohibited a limb torn from a living animal? - Adam was allowed to eat an animal that died of itself.<br />
