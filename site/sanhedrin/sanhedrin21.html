Rabbi Shimon says, "Even if one can turn his heart away, he may not marry her."<br />
<br />
The king may, however, have concubines. Tamar was David's daughter from a beautiful concubine captured in war. Amnon violated her and&nbsp; "...<a href="http://bible.cc/2_samuel/13-15.htm">hated her with a very great hatred</a>..." Why? Because she entangled her pubic hair around&nbsp; <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/23-1.htm">his member and cut it</a>. But Jewish women were renowned for not having pubic hair!? - Tamar was different.<br />
<br />
"<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">The king may not multiply horses</a>..." - only enough for his chariots. "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">And silver and gold he shall not accumulate overmuch</a>" - only enough to pay his soldier's wages.<br />
<br />
He writes a personal Torah scroll for himself and carries it with him at all times.<br />
