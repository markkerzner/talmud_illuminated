<h1>Sanhedrin 57 - The 7 Noahide Laws</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S8Fc-nUOeWI/AAAAAAAADfs/J7WL5WmUAhA/s1600/Manfredi+de+Battilor+Bartolo+Di+Fredi+Fredi+-+Noah+Building+the+Ark.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S8Fc-nUOeWI/AAAAAAAADfs/J7WL5WmUAhA/s320/Manfredi+de+Battilor+Bartolo+Di+Fredi+Fredi+-+Noah+Building+the+Ark.jpg" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">After Noah went out of the Ark, he was given seven laws for the following generations: civil law to enforce the other six prohibitions, prohibitions of blasphemy, idolatry, sexual transgressions, murder, theft, and eating a limb torn from a live animal. For the violation of three transgressions a Noahide may be executed: for sexual transgressions, murder, and "blessing" the Divine Name. Some add idolatry to this list, and some say that for violation of any of the seven Noahide laws, a Noahite is executed.<br />
<br />
A Noahite is executed by one judge, on the basis of the testimony of one witness, and even though he violated the prohibition without having received prior warning, and a man who judges or testifies can even be a relative of the accused.<br />
