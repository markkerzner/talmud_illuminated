<h1>Sanhedrin 70 - What Must a Boy Do to Earn the Designation of Wayward and Rebellious Son</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S9HOitH7v4I/AAAAAAAADjc/bCullgYfuqE/s1600/Vincent+Van+Gogh+-+Still+Life+With+Apples+Meat+And+A+Roll.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S9HOitH7v4I/AAAAAAAADjc/bCullgYfuqE/s320/Vincent+Van+Gogh+-+Still+Life+With+Apples+Meat+And+A+Roll.jpg" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">A wayward and rebellious son is executed because he engages in the type of gluttony that will lead him to murder. He incurs liability if he eats a large measure of meat, called tarteimar (about 1.5 pounds), and drinks half a log (volume of three eggs) of Italian wine, which is habit-forming. Rabbi Yossi doubles these measures. <br />
<br />
He must buy that meat with the money stolen from his father, and it should be a repeat offender, with prior warning and flogging.<br />
<br />
If he ate it at a gathering that involves a mitzvah, or at a meal convened to publicize the intercalation of a day into a month, or as second tithe in Jerusalem, if he ate an animal that died of itself, or one that was not properly slaughtered, if he ate non-kosher birds or non-kosher seafood, if he ate something from which tithes have not been separated - for all these he does not earn the designation, as it says, "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-20.htm">...A glutton and a guzzler</a>." <br />
