"Burning" does not mean that the convict is set on fire, but rather that molten lead is poured down his throat.<br />
<br />
One who cohabits with a woman and her daughter, and the married daughter of a Kohen who commits adultery - however, the man who committed adultery with her is strangled, like all other adulterers. Similar to the category of a woman and her daughter, one is burned for cohabiting with his daughter, his daughter's daughter and his son's daughter, his wife's daughter, her daughter's daughter and her son's daughter; his mother-in-law, his mother-in-law's mother and his father-in-law's mother.<br />
