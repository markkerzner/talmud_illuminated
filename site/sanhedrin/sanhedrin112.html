<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TAl_yHkZHgI/AAAAAAAADuw/oPy2bZPIHiw/s1600/Egon+Schiele+-+Yellow+City.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TAl_yHkZHgI/AAAAAAAADuw/oPy2bZPIHiw/s320/Egon+Schiele+-+Yellow+City.jpg" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">The inhabitants of a subverted city - that is, a city the majority of whose residents were subverted into worshiping an idol -  are executed by beheading, and not by stoning, like in the regular case of idol worship. However, there are many preconditions. The subverters have to be men from this city, and not their agents. People have to be subverted and not decide to worship idols on their own. Each person needs to receive a warning with two witnesses. A caravan lodging in the city, if it was not subverted, saves the city.<br />
<br />
The property of the subverted city's residents is destroyed by burning, even that of the righteous ones - for they should not have resided with such neighbors.<br />
