<h1>Sanhedrin 60 - Idol Worship Liability</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S8UwjAVYevI/AAAAAAAADg0/g_KrnFEKu6Q/s1600/Maria+Hadfield+Cosway+-+Persian+Lady+Worshipping+the+Rising+Sun.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S8UwjAVYevI/AAAAAAAADg0/g_KrnFEKu6Q/s320/Maria+Hadfield+Cosway+-+Persian+Lady+Worshipping+the+Rising+Sun.jpg" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">One is liable for idol worship if he serves an idol in its usual way, that is, does any action that is the normal manner of worship for a particular idol, including embracing and kissing, etc., and even a disgraceful act. Additionally, one is liable is he performs one of the four services used in the Temple: slaughters an offering, burns an offering, pours a libation, or bows down to an idol, even if that is not its usual manner of service. One is also liable if he accepts the idol upon himself as a deity, or says to it, "You are my god."<br />
<br />
However, if one embraces, kisses, sweeps, sprinkles water, or washes, anoints, clothes, or shoes  an idol, he merely transgresses a negative commandment. If one vows in the name of an idol or swears in its name, one transgresses a negative commandment. Defecating to Baal Pe'or and throwing a stone at Markulis is a normal manner of service for these idols.<br />
