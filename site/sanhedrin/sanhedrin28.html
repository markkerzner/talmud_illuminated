<h1>Sanhedrin 28 - Relatives Disqualified as Judges or Witnesses</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S5qljace8uI/AAAAAAAADZU/9NViSb_7b2o/s1600-h/Isaac+Oliver+-+The+Browne+Brothers.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S5qljace8uI/AAAAAAAADZU/9NViSb_7b2o/s320/Isaac+Oliver+-+The+Browne+Brothers.JPG" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">The disqualification of relatives is absolute: they may not testify whether their testimony is favorable or detrimental. The relatives include: one's brother, uncle, sister's husband, aunt's husband, father-in-law, brother-in-law, and also their sons and sons-in-law.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehudah says: "One's close friend and one's enemy are also disqualified." But the Sages say that the Jewish people are not suspected of bearing false witness about someone because of love or animosity.<br />
<br />
How does one understand "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Fathers shall not be put to death because of their sons nor shall sons be put to death because of their fathers</a>..."? We already know that "...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">each man shall be put to death only because of his own sin</a>." Therefore, we have to understand that "Fathers shall not be put to death because of the testimony of their sons."<br />
