Abaye Kashisha said, "Discord is like a plank in a bridge: once people walk on it, it becomes firm and stays firm."<br />
<br />
One man liked to say, "Fortunate is one who hears his denigration without responding. A hundred misfortunes will pass him by." Said Rav Yehudah, "beginning of discord (ראשית מדון)" can be translated as beginning of a hundred misfortunes (ריש מאה דיני).<br />
<br />
One man liked to say, "When our love was strong, we could have lain together on the width of a sword, but now a bed of sixty amot (100 feet) does not suffice for us." Said Rav Huna - and so it is with God, at first it was "...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/25-22.htm">and I will meet you (Moses) there and speak to you</a>..." from above the ten hand-breadth </span><span style="font-size: medium;">Ark</span><span style="font-size: medium;">, but later about the Temple built by Solomon "...<a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/66-1.htm">Says God - what house can you build for me</a>?"</span><br />
