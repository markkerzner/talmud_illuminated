Whether the rescuer is actually executed by the courts for killing the pursuer, or whether he is subject to death by the hands of Heaven - is a subject of disagreement between later authorities.<br />
<br />
If someone being pursued broke items of the pursuer, he is exempt from paying, but if he broke items belonging to any other person, he is liable. However, if the rescuer was chasing the pursuer to prevent him from committing murder and broke vessels of any party, he is always exempt, because otherwise nobody would be saving his fellow from the pursuer.<br />
