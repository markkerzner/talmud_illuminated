Yossi says, "It is forbidden for a judge to arbitrate a compromise." It is certainly permissible for disputants to settle out of court, or to ask an arbitrator to help them. However, once they come to court, the judge who arbitrates a compromise shows that in his opinion the compromise settlement is more correct than an appropriate ruling based on Torah law. Furthermore, in settlement the would-be winner is robbed of some money.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korcha </span><span style="font-size: medium;">says</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> on the contrary that before the verdict it is a meritorious deed for a judge to arbitrate a compromise - "...<a href="http://bible.cc/zechariah/8-16.htm">execute truth and judgment of piece</a>...", and "judgment of piece" means compromise - like king David, who "...<a href="http://bible.cc/2_samuel/8-15.htm">rendered judgment and righteousness</a>..." And Rabbi Eliezer explains that king David would render a strict judgment first, but then if the loosing party was poor, he would pay his own money.<br />
