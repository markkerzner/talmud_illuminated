However, Rabbi Yehudah says that they do not delay the judgment, but rather execute him immediately, and then write out proclamations and send messengers to all places.<br />
<br />
A false prophet is executed at the hands of man, but one who suppresses his prophecy, one who disregards the word of a prophet, or a prophet who transgresses his own words is subject to death at the hands of Heaven. <br />
