<h1>Sanhedrin 43 - Distance Between The Court and the Place of Execution</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S7DvZl5ZjQI/AAAAAAAADdU/Iw1qVA2bYHA/s1600/Eugene+Fromentin+-+Arab+Encampment+in+the+Atlas+Mountains.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S7DvZl5ZjQI/AAAAAAAADdU/Iw1qVA2bYHA/s320/Eugene+Fromentin+-+Arab+Encampment+in+the+Atlas+Mountains.jpg" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;"> The execution must be "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/24-14.htm">outside the camp</a>," but how far outside? Should we compare it to the law of bulls brought for communal error, about which it is also stated "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/4-21.htm">outside the camp</a>," and there it means outside the farthest of the three camps, or to forbidden sacrifice "<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/17-3.htm">outside the camp</a>," where "outside" means only outside one camp, the Temple proper?<br />
<br />
There are four points of commonality between execution and the law of bulls: removal, outside the camp, preparation (both prepare for something), and atonement (both atone). There are also four points of commonality with the forbidden sacrifices: they apply to a person, a sinner, a life is being taken, and sacrificial disqualification does not apply.<br />
<br />
However, we should rather compare those laws that prepare for something, thus execution is compared to the law of bulls, and the place of execution is removed three camps from the courthouse.<br />
