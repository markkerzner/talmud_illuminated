<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S949PfRwfkI/AAAAAAAADlQ/_tP0uGgG5K8/s1600/Frank+Duveneck+-+The+Cobbler%27s+Apprentice.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S949PfRwfkI/AAAAAAAADlQ/_tP0uGgG5K8/s320/Frank+Duveneck+-+The+Cobbler%27s+Apprentice.jpg" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">If one intended to kill an animal but killed a man instead, he is not liable, since he lacked the intent to kill a man. If one intended to kill an idolater but killed a Jew instead, he cannot be executed by a Jewish court. While it is certainly forbidden to kill any human being, this matter is outside of the jurisdiction of Sanhedrin. If one intended to kill a premature, nonviable baby, but killed a viable one instead, he is not liable to execution, because the warning given to him would have been uncertain.<br />
<br />
If he intended to strike an adult with a blow not sufficient to kill an adult, but it landed on a child instead, and it was sufficient to kill a child, and the child died, he is not liable, because he did not intend to commit murder, and any warning would be uncertain.<br />
