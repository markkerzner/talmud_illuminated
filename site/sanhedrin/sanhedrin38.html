<h1>Sanhedrin 38 - Know What to Answer a Heretic</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S6guQiO07rI/AAAAAAAADb0/9xaZEsbvujc/s1600-h/William+Blake+-+Elohim+Creating+Adam.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S6guQiO07rI/AAAAAAAADb0/9xaZEsbvujc/s320/William+Blake+-+Elohim+Creating+Adam.jpg" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">Said Rabbi Eliezer: "Be diligent in the study of Torah and know what to answer a heretic," so that you can answer the challenges that are based on Scripture. Said Rabbi Yochanan, "That is only with regard to a pagan heretic, but as for a Jewish heretic, do not debate him, for he will become even more heretical." <br />
<br />
Continued Rabbi Yochanan, "Wherever the heretics have used a verse in Scripture as support for their arguments, the rebuttal can be found in a nearby verse." For example, it is written "<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/1-26.htm">Let us (plural) make man in our (plural) image</a>..." But the next verse says, "<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/1-27.htm">God created man in His image</a>..." Then why is the plural form used at all? To show that The Holy One, Blessed is He, never does anything unless He first consults with the Heavenly Court.<br />
