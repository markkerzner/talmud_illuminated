<br />
Measuring which town is nearest has to be carried out by three judges, members of the Great Sanhedrin. The decapitation of the calf is then performed by the court of the town which is nearest.<br />
<br />
Normally, however, the members of the Sanhedrin do not leave the Chamber of Hewn Stones in the Temple, since "<a href="http://bible.cc/songs/7-2.htm">Your navel is like a moon-shaped basin; let not the strength of the blend diminish</a>..." is </span><span style="font-size: medium;"> talking </span><span style="font-size: medium;">allegorically about the members of the Sanhedrin, who sat in a semicircle.<br />
