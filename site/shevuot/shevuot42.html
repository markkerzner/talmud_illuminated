<h1>Shevuot 42 - When an Oath is Not Required</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TF-PoynibdI/AAAAAAAAEBU/Ybm_FZrBiwE/s1600/John+George+Brown+-+Woman+Seated+At+Window.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TF-PoynibdI/AAAAAAAAEBU/Ybm_FZrBiwE/s320/John+George+Brown+-+Woman+Seated+At+Window.jpg" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">These are things regarding which one need not swear: slaves, notes of indebtedness, land, and consecrated property. Incidentally, for these things one is not liable to a twofold penalty for theft, nor to  the fourfold and fivefold penalty for stealing, killing, and selling an animal.<br />
<br />
An unpaid custodian, who ordinarily must swear that he was not negligent in guarding an object entrusted in his care, does not have to swear for these things. A paid custodian, who is ordinarily liable for theft, does not have to swear and does not pay for those things.<br />
<br />
An oath requires a definite measure. For example, if one says, "I delivered a house full of produce to you for safekeeping," or "a purse full of money," and the guardian says, "I do not know how much you gave, but I am giving you back everything," - he does not have to swear. However, if he says that the produce reached to the ceiling beam, and the guardian says that it only reached the window - the guardian has to swear due to his partial admission.<br />
