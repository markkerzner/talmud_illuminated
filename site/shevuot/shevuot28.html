Additional ones do not take effect, since the first one already prohibited the loaf to him. If, however, the first oath is annulled, the second one takes effect.<br />
<br />
Aifa studied oaths in the academy of Rabbah. His brother Avimi met him and asked a question, "If one takes an oath that he has not eaten today, and then repeats it, what is the law?" Aifa said, "He transgressed once." "Wrong!" - said Avimi - "These are two false oaths."<br />
<br />
Avimi asked another question, "An oath that I will not eat nine figs, an oath that I will not eat ten!" Aifa answered, "Liable for each oath." "Wrong!" - said Avimi - "If he cannot eat nine figs, then he cannot eat ten." <br />
<br />
Avimi asked a third question, "'An oath that I will not eat ten figs, an oath that I will not eat nine,' - and then he ate ten, what is the law?" Aifa answered, "He transgressed once, since the second oath is included in the first." "Wrong!" - said Avimi - "The first oath prohibits ten figs, but allows nine, so the second oath is stricter than the first!" - and if he eats ten figs, he transgresses two oaths.<br />
