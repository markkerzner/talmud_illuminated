<h1>Shevuot 25 - The Scope of Oaths is All-Inclusive</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TEh9eefbMbI/AAAAAAAAD8k/eXu3zCXbrik/s1600/Jan+Vermeer+Van+Delft+-+A+Woman+Asleep+at+Table.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TEh9eefbMbI/AAAAAAAAD8k/eXu3zCXbrik/s320/Jan+Vermeer+Van+Delft+-+A+Woman+Asleep+at+Table.jpg" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">An oath takes effect regarding both matters relevant to oneself and relevant to another, regarding both matters of substance and those lacking substance.<br />
<br />
For example, if one swears "I will give something to so-and-so" or "I will not give it to him," or "I swear that I gave it to him" or "I swear that I did not give it to him," - this is an oath about others.<br />
<br />
If he said, "I swear that I will sleep" or "that I will not sleep," "I slept" or "I did not sleep" - these are oaths concerning intangible matters.<br />
<br />
If one said, "I swear that I will throw a pebble into the sea" or "I will not throw the pebble," "I threw the pebble" or "I did not throw" - these are oaths concerning non-beneficial acts.<br />
