<h1>Shevuot 23 - Not To Eat Bread!</h1>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TEZBOr5BhgI/AAAAAAAAD78/vVogLfv-3Uk/s1600/Johannes+Vermeer+-+The+Milkmaid.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/TEZBOr5BhgI/AAAAAAAAD78/vVogLfv-3Uk/s320/Johannes+Vermeer+-+The+Milkmaid.jpg" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">If one swore, "An oath that I will not eat!" - and then he ate wheat bread, barley bread and spelt bread - he is liable for only one offering. But if he swore, "An oath that I will not eat wheat bread, barley bread and spelt bread!" - and then he ate all three - he is liable for each one.<br />
<br />
But why? Maybe all he meant was "no breads," and this is all one oath? - If so, he should have said, "I will not eat wheat, barley and spelt." <br />
<br />
But maybe he meant to prohibit himself from chewing those grains? - If so, he should have said, "I will not eat <i>bread</i> of wheat, barley and spelt." Instead, he included the word "bread" every time, thus separating his oath into three separate oaths.<br />
