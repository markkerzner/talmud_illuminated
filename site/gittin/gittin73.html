The possession of the gift returns to him, and the Get should be void. However, the Get is decreed to take effect, to avoid the people thinking that the Get can work after the husband's death. Such mistake could lead to serious consequences.<br />
<br />
After receiving a conditional Get, the wife should not be alone with her husband, unless it is in the presence of witnesses - even witnesses not normally qualifying to give testimony.</span>
