A person born deaf-mute is presumed to lack clear understanding and can not contract a biblically binding marriage. Rabbinical enactments validated his marriage and divorce. Therefore, if his brother marries a woman and dies, and the wife falls to him in a levirate marriage, he lacks the legal power to divorce.
