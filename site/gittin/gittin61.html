<br />
One can deposit his tithed produce with a friend who is not careful about tithes, and should not suspect that the friend will substitute it. But what about the rule that one should tithe flour when he gives it to his mother-in-law and also after she bakes it into bread? His mother-in-law would substitute burned bread, to help her daughter.
