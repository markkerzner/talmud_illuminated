In all three cases, the Get is void because the husband stipulated  that it will take effect after his death and this is impossible.<br />
<br />
If he said, "This is your Get from today if I die from this illness," - it is a valid Get. It takes effect retroactively, but care must be taken not to invalidate the Get by living together.
