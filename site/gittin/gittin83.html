Rabbi Eliezer's learning was supreme, but after his death many Rabbis got together to disprove this teaching of his. However, all but one of their rebuttals had potential flaws.<br />
<br />
The undisputable proof came from Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria. He deduced the requirement of complete severance from the term that the Torah used, "Kritut," as opposed to a possible shorter word "Karet." This, according to Rabbi Elazar Ben Azaria, teaches that temporary conditions in the Get are valid, but permanent are not.
