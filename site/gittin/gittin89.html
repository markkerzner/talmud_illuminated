<br />
A rumor of marriage is recognized not by mere gossip, but when they say "We heard the rumor from so-and-so, and they heard it from so-and-so" and the court continued to investigate until they find two qualified witnesses who saw the betrothal feast and heard people say "So-and-so was betrothed today."
