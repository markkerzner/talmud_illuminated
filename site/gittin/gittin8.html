The Talmud also discusses which neighboring cities and areas are still considered the Land of Israel of this purpose and which are not. Would writing a Get on a ship close to Israel be considered the same as on land? 
<br />
<br />
Finally, is a ship the same as a flower pot? We mean the laws of tithes. Anything that grows on a ship does not directly draw sustenance from the Land of Israel, and anything that grows in a hanging pot does not do this either, so at first glance they should be the same. But maybe this is not so: a ship is constantly moving and thus cannot be considered connected to the ground, but a stable pot can. Or the opposite is true: the air divides between the pot and the earth, so the pot does not draw sustenance from the earth and is not liable to tithes, but a ship is in the water, which can be considered as a continuation of the water bed, and so maybe it is liable to tithes.
