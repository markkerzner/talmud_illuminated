The Jews of Har HaMelech used to take out a rooster and a hen for the wedding, implying that the newlywed should have many children, just like the rooster and the hen. Once, a band of Romans saw it and took the rooster away. Jews fell upon and killed them, and Caesar came with his army to take revenge.<br />
<br />
There was one of the Jews from the south who could jump a mile. He was so swift that he alone could kill all of the Roman army. Caesar put his crown on the ground and prayed, "Master of the entire world, do not let me be shamed through a single man." The southerner, however, said differently: "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2660.htm">God, you have forsaken us</a>," implying that he would defeat the Romans alone anyway. That was the cause of his downfall, since a snake bit him when he went into the toilet, and he died. Caesar retreated in gratitude that God answered his prayer. The Jews misunderstood and celebrated their victory. On seeing that, Caesar came back and destroyed Har HaMelech.<br />
<br />
The Talmud describes another place where righteous Jews were killed and asks, why? It answers -  because they did not mourn the destruction of Jerusalem - while <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1066.htm">one should be in joy when Jerusalem is being rebuilt and mourn when it is destroyed</a>.<br />
