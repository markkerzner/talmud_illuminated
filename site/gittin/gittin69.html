One can not use them nowadays because we are not certain of the exact meaning of the words, and because the nature of people and medicines has changed. Here is one such remedy.<br />
<br />
For cataracts - bring a scorpion that is spotted with seven colors because of its age, dry it out in the shade, grind it and make a powder consisting of two parts antimony and one part ground scorpion. Apply three doses to one eye and three doses to another. One must beware not to apply more, or the eyes may burst.
