<br />
Shammai school says: You have solved his master's dilemma, but you have not solved his own. For it is impossible for him to marry a slavewoman, because half of him is already a free man. And it is impossible for him to marry a free woman, because half of him is still a slave. And Hillel school reversed itself to rule in accordance with the words of Shammai school.<br />
