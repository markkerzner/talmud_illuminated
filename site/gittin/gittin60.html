<span style="color: black; font-family: Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 85%;">When reading the Haftarah, it is better to read from a complete Tanach, rather than from a book containing haftarah selections, to show respect for the listeners.<br /><br /><br />Was the Torah written on a complete scroll?</span><br />
<ul><span style="color: black; font-family: Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 85%;">
<li>No, it was written on separate scrolls, which Moshe connected together before his death. Proof? - "<a href="http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sydhercab.0.0.v855dncab.0&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mechon-mamre.org%2Fp%2Fpt%2Fpt2640.htm&amp;id=preview" linktype="link" target="_blank" track="on">Then said I: Lo, I am come with the <span style="color: #990000;">scroll of a book</span> which is prescribed for me.</a>"</li>
</span></ul>
<ul><span style="color: black; font-family: Verdana,Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 85%;">
<li>Yes: Moshe remembered every section as it was taught, and then wrote them all before his death. Proof? - "<a href="http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=sydhercab.0.0.v855dncab.0&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mechon-mamre.org%2Fp%2Fpt%2Fpt0531.htm&amp;id=preview" linktype="link" target="_blank" track="on">Take <span style="color: #990000;">this book</span> of the law</a>."</li>
</span></ul>
