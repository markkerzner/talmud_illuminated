<br />
According to Rabbi Meir, the woman needs to leave her new husband if she re-married, but can not return to her previous husband. She also looses her Ketubah payment from both, and many other benefits.<br />
<br />
However, prevailing ruling is that she does need another Get but is not penalized as above.
