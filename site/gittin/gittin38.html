<h1>Gittin 38 - Freeing the slaves</h1>

<br />
<br />
If the redemption is in order to free the slave, the slave achieves freedom and does not even need a document of emancipation. Since he was a slave of a Jew, he now becomes a full-fledged Jew and can marry a Jewish woman.
<br />
<br />
If the redeemer wants to keep him as a slave, he can, and the captor, who owns the work of his hands, can transmit the ownership further.
<br />
<br />
Slaves should not be redeemed, except for a good cause.
