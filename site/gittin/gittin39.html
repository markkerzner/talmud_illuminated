<h1>Gittin 39 - Freeing one's slave</h1>
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-y5KKOS8YVWc/VqIpPfv6KcI/AAAAAAAAYpU/hCiksa2fjys/s1600/28.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-y5KKOS8YVWc/VqIpPfv6KcI/AAAAAAAAYpU/hCiksa2fjys/s200/28.jpg" width="165" /></a>If a master makes his slave ownerless, the slave is free, but requires a letter of emancipation (Get), because he did not acquire himself.
<br />
<br />
However, when a convert dies without children or wife, his adult slaves go free and do not need a Get, because they become their own masters, then free themselves.
<br />
A slavewoman begged her dying master to free her. He threw her a hat intending for her to acquire herself through "exchange". But he did not achieve anything - not because a letter of emancipation was still needed, but because the hat was his.<br />
