<br />
<br />
However, when a convert dies without children or wife, his adult slaves go free and do not need a Get, because they become their own masters, then free themselves.
<br />
A slavewoman begged her dying master to free her. He threw her a hat intending for her to acquire herself through "exchange". But he did not achieve anything - not because a letter of emancipation was still needed, but because the hat was his.<br />
