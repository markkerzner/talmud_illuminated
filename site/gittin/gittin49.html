Money and readily-sold personalty, if available, are first choice.<br />
<br />
Creditors  collect their payments from the medium quality land - so that people would not refrain from making loans. However, since money was loaned, if the borrower has money, he pays that.<br />
<br />
Ketubah payments are collected from the inferior land, in order to prevent women who unscrupulously marry in order to provoke divorce and collect their ketubah dowers.<br />
<br />
These measures are for the benefit of society.
