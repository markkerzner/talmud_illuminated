<br />
If he was on his roof above and she was in her courtyard below, and he threw the Get to her, once it leaves the domain of the roof - even if it is erased or burnt before it lands in the courtyard - she is divorced.<br />
<br />
After the Get is written, the husband and wife can not be alone together.
