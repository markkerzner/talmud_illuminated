<br />
A slave of two masters was freed by one. The second transferred ownership to his underage son, to prevent the court from emancipating the slave. The court commanded to jingle a few coins in front of the child, who agreed to sell the slave and was then paid in full.<br />
<br />
If one says, "I make my slave a free man," the slave is free. But it has to be in writing. Same for a field transfer.<br />
