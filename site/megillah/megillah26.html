<h1>Megillah 26 - Selling a synagogue</h1>
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VSukco64ZC4/U-JdY-mRW3I/AAAAAAAAUSk/FjJgDHTnTns/s1600/A+Cathedral+On+A+Townsquare+In+Summer+by+Cornelis+Springer.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VSukco64ZC4/U-JdY-mRW3I/AAAAAAAAUSk/FjJgDHTnTns/s1600/A+Cathedral+On+A+Townsquare+In+Summer+by+Cornelis+Springer.jpg" height="246" width="320" /></a>The townspeople who sold the town square are allowed to buy a synagogue with the proceeds, but if they sold a synagogue, they are not allowed to buy a town square with the money.
<br />
<br />
What is special about a town square? Going back <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/search/label/Taanit">Taanit</a>, we know that people used to <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/06/taanit-15-not-everyones-prayer-is-equal.html">pray there on the seven strict fast days</a>, so this teacher holds that this gives the town square some degree of holiness. 
<br />
<br />
In any case, we see here the rule of "we bring up in holiness but don't bring down." What is the source for this rule? For the first part, we get it from Betzalel creating the Tabernacle object, and then Moses, who was on the higher level, putting it together. The "don't bring down" part is learned from the two hundred and fifty people who joined Korach in his revolt: the pans which they used to offer the incense were not disposed of but beaten into the covering for the Altar.
<br />
<br />
What about keeping on the same level? For example, can one sell a synagogue in order to buy another one? The rule leaves it open, and there are two opinions ("yes" and "no"), but in practice it is permitted. With the synagogue, there are also other considerations: care must be taken to prevent negligence of not buying or building another synagogue later.
<br />
<br />
If the people in a village built a synagogue building strictly for themselves, their authorized representatives can sell it in the presence of the residents of the place. However, a city synagogue is usually built with contributions from out-of-town people, and for the use of everyone, so in general it cannot be sold.
