<h1>Megillah 3 – Which is more important</h1>
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3LFhvScv14g/U8Xu4dFgYJI/AAAAAAAAUDw/5qnY8zUGZ-g/s1600/Interior+with+a+scholar+and+an+old+lady+spinning+by+Jacob+van+Spreeuwen.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3LFhvScv14g/U8Xu4dFgYJI/AAAAAAAAUDw/5qnY8zUGZ-g/s1600/Interior+with+a+scholar+and+an+old+lady+spinning+by+Jacob+van+Spreeuwen.jpg" height="267" width="320" /></a>Purim is to be celebrated “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3309.htm">in every province, every city, and every family</a>.” Since the intent is already clear, what do we want from each word? --- That even the Kohanim and the Levites leave their Temple service and go to listen to the Megillah. We can deduce that the Torah scholars, whose service is not as stringent, certainly close the books and go read the Megillah. 
<br />
<br />
But is this really true and the Temple service is more important that the study of the Torah? Don't we have <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0605.htm">the story of Joshua</a>, where an angel came to him and said, “You are guilty of two transgressions: yesterday you neglected the daily sacrifice and today – the study of the Torah, but I, the angel, came today because of this last, which is more important?” So the study of the Torah is more important, and perhaps the Sages should not close their books and go to read the Megillah? There is a difference: the Torah study of Israel is more important than anything else, but the Torah study of an individual gives the right-of-way to the sacrifices, and certainly to the reading of the Megillah.
<br />
<br />
Rava asked a question: both reading the Megillah and burying the unattended corpse are more important than the sacrifices, but of these two, which has precedence? Then Rava himself gave the answer: human dignity overrides even Torah prohibitions,  so burying the unattended corpse is certainly more important than listening to the Megillah.
