<h1>Megillah 32 – After reading the Torah</h1>

This person takes away the reward of all the previous ones. How could it be? – The Talmud likes to emphasize things. Rather, his reward is equal to all of the previous ones combined.

With all that we said about the Torah on the previous pages, how could God say, “I, too, will give you laws that are not good?” Rabbi Yochanan says that it is talking about someone who is learning, but does not express his joy of learning in singing. However Abaye asked about this, “Just because someone does not know how to sing nicely, he deserves the bad words?” Rather, it is talking about two Sages who live in the same city but not discuss Torah between them. 
<br />
<br />
Finally, the phrase “And Moses told the laws of the Holidays to all Israel” teaches that he established a custom to learn the laws of each Festival on or before its time. It is customary to connect the end of a Tractate with its beginning – and here we can remember that <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/07/megillah-2-times-to-read-megillah.html">the beginning of this Tractate discussed when the people should read the Megillah</a> – which obviously requires study in advance.
