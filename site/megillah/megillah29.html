However, this is only when there are not enough people to honor the dead. And how many is enough? - Twelve thousand, just as the number of men who went to war with Midian. Others, however, say, that it is six hundred thousand: just as the Torah was given to the soul in the presence of six hundred thousand people, so it is taken away with six hundred thousand.

Abaye said, "Initially I learned Torah at home and prayed in the synagogue. Once I understood how God loves the synagogue, I learn and pray there." In another place, we have an opposite teaching, about praying in the place of learning. The synagogue is called "a small Temple," and in the future all synagogues and study halls will be transplanted to Israel.
<br />
<br />
Close to Purim, in Adar, there are four special Torah portions read in the synagogue. They are: half-shekel collection for the Temple - because of its timing in the next month, the portion of destroying Amalek - because of its connection to Purim, the red heifer - because it was used to purify the people before the Holidays, and "this month will be for you to celebrate Passover" - because by then it is already Passover time.
