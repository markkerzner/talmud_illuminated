<br />
<br />
Why did Ahashverosh invite the subjects from distant lands first? Some say that it was because he was clever - the people of his own capital city Shushan he could appease any time. Other says that he was stupid: he should have invited his closest people first, and in case of rebellion they would have protected him.

The students of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai asked him, "Why were the 'enemies of Israel' (euphemism for the Jewish people) on the brink of extinction?"  He said, "You say the reason." They answered, "Because they ate at the feast of Ahashverosh." He questioned, "If so, only the people in Shushan should have been punished." They then asked, "And what is your reason?" Rabbi Shimon told them, "Because they bowed down to an idol." The students then asked, "If so, they should not avoid punishment!" He told them, "They did not mean it, and lacked conviction. So too, God did not mean it and only scared them."
<br />
<br />
What does it mean, "On the seventh day the king's heart was merry with wine." And before it was not? - However, this was Shabbat, when people relaxed. When the Sages relax, they discuss knowledge and praise God. But his guests, when relaxed, started discussing which women, Persian or Midian were the most beautiful. This lead the king to tell them that his wife Vashti was from the nation of Chaldeans and was the most beautiful. They asked to see her, in crown but nothing else, but she would not come. Why would not she? Because the angel Gavriel came and made her grow a tail.
