They water the fields that had been plowed and sown by this time, for the grain that will appear in the spring. There are many different opinions as to the days when these rains are expected to fall. But what practical significance does it have?
<br />
<br />
For the early rainfall the answer is clear: it falls in the beginning of the rain season, and we need to know the date when to start praying, so that this rain should indeed come. For the last one it is also obvious: if no rain fell by then, special pious individuals would begin to fast.<br />
<br />
The question is really about the middle one: why do we need to when to expect it? It turns out that the knowledge of this date, too, is important in many places of the law. For example, for vows: if one vows not to eat a certain fruit until the rains come, it is presumed that he meant the middle ones. It also matters for gleanings. Normally, gleanings are reserved only for the poor. However, when even the poor abandon them and are not collecting them any longer - then any person can take them. When the last, slow and meticulous poor go through the fields, then nobody else has a hope to find significant amount of gleanings. Then the legal owners of them - the poor - despair of finding any more and give them up. This gives the grains the legal status of ownerless, and thus available to anybody. What is the date for that? - The time of the second rain.<br />
<br />
When one sees the rain after a period of drought, he should say, "Blessed is God for every drop of rain." In Israel, where rains are scarce, one actually says this at the time when he sees the first rain in the rainy winter season.
