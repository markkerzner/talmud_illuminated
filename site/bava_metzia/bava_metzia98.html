<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">A man borrowed a cow for half a day and rented it for half a day, and the cow died. The lender claims, "It died while being borrowed," making the borrower liable, but the borrower says "I don't know" - the borrower is liable.</span></div>
<div>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div>
<div>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Can we disprove from here the following ruling of Rav Nachman? If one claims to another, "you owe me a maneh (100 zuz)" and the other one says, "I don't know if I owe you" - the defendant is NOT liable. But in the first ruling he is!</span></div>
<div>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div>
<div>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Rav Nachman will answer that the first ruling is talking about two cows, and about one of them the borrower agrees to his liability. This makes it a case of</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/04/bava-metzia-3.html"> borrower admitting in part</a>,  so that he has to swear, but not knowing about the second claim, he can't swear and thus has to pay.</span></div>
