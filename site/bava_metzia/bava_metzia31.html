How is a finder to determine whether the objects he has found is truly lost? If he found a donkey or  a cow grazing by the road, this is not considered a lost object. If he found a donkey with its gear overturned, or a cow running through the vineyards, this is indeed a lost object.</div>

If one returned an animal and it ran away, and this happened four or five times, he is still obligated to return it yet again, because it is stated “...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/22-1.htm">return, you shall return them</a>...” For missed work he gets  compensation only as a laborer. But if the stipulates his wage in court, he can get it.</div>
