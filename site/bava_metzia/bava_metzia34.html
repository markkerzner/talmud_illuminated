<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-7.htm">Unpaid custodian</a> must safeguard the object but not use it, and is liable for any loss caused by his negligence;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Paid custodian also may not use the object, but because he is being paid, he is liable even for theft or loss not due to his negligence;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;">Renter pays for the right to use another's property, and his liability is identical to that of the paid custodian;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: medium;"><a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-14.htm">Borrower</a> bears the highest degree of responsibility - he is liable even for mishaps beyond his control, with the exception of work-related damages.</span></li>
</ul>
