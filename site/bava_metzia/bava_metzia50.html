The law in any particular case depends on two factors: the amount of the fraud, and the period of time that elapses between the transaction and the time the defrauded party protests.<br />
<br />
</span><br />
<div>
<span style="font-size: medium;">If the amount of price fraud is the discrepancy of less than 1/6, the sale stands and all claims are immediately waived. If the amount is exactly 1/6, the buyer can demand a refund. If the amount is more than one sixth, either party can void the sale.</span></div>
<div>
<span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div>
<div>
<span style="font-size: medium;">The defrauded party has as much time as it takes to show the purchase to a merchant or to his relative for assessment.</span></div>
