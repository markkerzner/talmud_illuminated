One says "I found it first," and the other one says "I found it first." One says, "It is mine," and the other one says, "It is mine." One must swear that he owns no less than half of it, and other one must swear that he owns no less that half of it, and they then divide it - if possible, or sell it and divide the money.</div><div>
