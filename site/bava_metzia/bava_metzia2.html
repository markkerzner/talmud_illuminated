One says, "I found it first," and the other says, "I found it first." One says, "It is mine," and the other says, "It is mine." One must swear that he owns no less than half of it, and the other one must swear that he owns no less than half of it, and they then divide it - if possible, or sell it and divide the money.</div><div><br /></div><div>
</div><div>Why claim "It is mine?" It's another case where they both gave money to the storekeeper and now argue whose is the article.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art:&nbsp;Basil Woodhouse - Pulling the Favourite, cartoon from Tatler magazine, 1st December 1909</div>
