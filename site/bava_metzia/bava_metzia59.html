<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">A man must be especially careful not to offend his wife with his words - or any other woman - because with her tears she may bring retribution on him. One must also be very careful about his wife's honor, because a person's house is blessed only on account of his wife.</span></div>

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Rabbi Eliezer and the Sages argued about the purity of sectional ovens. Rabbi Eliezer performed multiple miracles, but it was no proof. Heavenly voice said that he was right - but the Torah is not in Heaven, but rather decided by knowledgeable men. The Sages then rightfully excommunicated him. Still, since he was upset, a third of the world's crops rotted and Rabban Gamliel died.</span></div>
