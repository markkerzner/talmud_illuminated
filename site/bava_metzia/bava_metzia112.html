If the craftsman acquires the improvements, he in effect sells the owner that portion when he returns the finished product, and the money that the owner owes is not considered wages but a loan.<br /><br />The prevailing view, however, is that the craftsman does not acquire the improvements and that the payments owed to him are thus wages, hence the prohibition against delaying payments applies to contractual work.</span>
