If the deer was running normally, or if the pigeons were flying, and he said, "My field has acquired it for me," - he has said nothing.</div><div><br /></div><div>This method of acquisition is called "courtyard." Â The owner doesn't have to declare his intention - it is only stated to emphasize the second case in the ruling. He does have to stand next to his field, making it comparable to a courtyard.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a87607/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></div>
