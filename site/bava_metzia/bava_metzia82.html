<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">When a porter carries someone's keg from one place to another, he has the legal responsibility of a custodian. If he accidentally slips and breaks the keg, then Rabbi Meir says that whether he is paid or not, he can swear and free himself from liability.</span></div>

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div>
<div>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Rabbi Yehudah says that slipping is negligence. Therefore, a paid porter is liable for it, as any paid custodian, but an unpaid porter is not.</span></div>
<div>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div>
<div>
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">And Rabbi Meir? He agrees that stumbling is considered negligence, but since people are usually not careful about it, the Rabbis made a decree that a porter can be absolved through an oath, because otherwise nobody will move a keg of his fellow. He swears that he did not break it deliberately.</span></div>
