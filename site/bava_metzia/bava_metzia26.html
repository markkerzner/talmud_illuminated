Â </div><div><br /></div><div>Normally, they should be returned to the last renter, but here we are dealing with a case of three people renting together. If one of them lost coins and can't find them, he despairs of getting them back. He thinks of the other two: "They probably took the coins and intend to keep them. But if I confront one, he can tell me that it was the other, and I can't make him to take an oath." Thus the finder can keep them.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://mystudiyo.com/ch/a88650/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></div></div>
