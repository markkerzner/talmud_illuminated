If one of them lost coins and can't find them, he despairs of getting them back. He thinks of the other two: "They probably took the coins and intend to keep them. But if I confront one, he can tell me it was the other, and I can't make him take an oath." Thus, the finder can keep them.</div><div><br /></div></div><div>Art: A Chelsea Interior by Robert Scott Tait</div>
