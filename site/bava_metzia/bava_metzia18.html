It is possible that they were written with the intent to give them, but the author reconsidered and decided not to give them, and it was he who lost them. The above documents effect the transaction, thus, if the writer lost them, they don't take effect.</div><div><br /></div><div>Wills are generally not effective in Torah law; unless formal gift has been made before death, property passes automatically to the rightful heirs defined by the Torah. Sickbed will is an exception.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a88071/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></div>
