One should protect living beings from suffering, as evidenced by <a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/22-32.htm">the angel rebuking Balaam for striking his she-ass</a>.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
But consider this ruling: if one has a choice whether to unload his friend's animal, which is suffering under a load, or to load his enemy's one - he should load his enemy's, in order to subdue his own Evil Inclination. What about the animal suffering? - Subduing one's Evil Inclination is more important.</div>

<div>
Retrieving his lost article takes precedence over the lost article of his father or his teacher. A lost article of his teacher takes precedence over that of his father, unless his father is also a Sage. </div>
