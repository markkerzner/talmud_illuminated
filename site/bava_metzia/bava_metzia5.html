What does the custodian admit? That the article is intact in his possession. But that is exactly the case of "here, it is yours," which contradicts Rav Sheshet, who says that no oath is required! And Rav Sheshet? He will tell you that in this case the custodian borrowed three cows, all of them died, and he admits to being negligent regarding one, so it is not the case of "here, it is yours."</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a87302/go">Test yourself</a></div>
