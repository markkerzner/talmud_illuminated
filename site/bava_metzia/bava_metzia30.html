For example, an elderly person is not required to pick up an  object that is beneath his dignity.<br /><br />Concerning the areas in which Moses should instruct the Jews, the words "...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/18-20.htm">that they shall do</a>..." refer to maintaining a standard of conduct that goes beyond the letter of the law. Said Rabbi Yochanan: "Jerusalem was destroyed only because Jews didn't go beyond the letter of the law."<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a88835/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a>
