Similarly, if a robber, who robs openly, took from one and gave to the other, again the recipient may keep it.<br />
<br />
The case of a robber is understandable - the owner despairs of getting his things back, and the recipient thus acquires them. But in the case of a thief the owner is not aware of his loss! It must be that the despair which will come later is already effective, just like<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/talmud_daily/7057.html"> Rava and not Abaye</a>? No! The "thief" is an armed robber, who is like a thief in that he hides - so here too the owner despairs.<br />
