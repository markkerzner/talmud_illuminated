Since the field was never his, the purchase money is considered a loan. The payment for improvement looks like interest which is forbidden – says Shmuel. The accepted ruling is that the purchaser has the right to improvements.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a87857/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a>
