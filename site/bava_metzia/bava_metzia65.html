<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">For example, if one rented a house to someone and said, "If you pay me for the year in advance - 10 sela, but if you pay every month, 1 sela a month" - the rent is the true price, and the discount is given for paying early. However, if he sold a field, the money is owed right away, and paying more later is a reward for waiting for money, which is prohibited.</span></div>
