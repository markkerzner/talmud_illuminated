If a rumor circulated or one witness testified that the captive died, then the court can. The relative stands to inherit, so he will be careful with the property. What if his whereabouts are unknown?</div>

Can the law be derived from "...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-24.htm">and I shall become incensed, and I shall kill you...and your children will be orphans</a>"? If a person is killed, of course, his children are orphans! Instead, it must mean, AS IF orphans, that is, not using the land? No! - It could mean not inheriting.</div>
