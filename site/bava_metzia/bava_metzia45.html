One possible method of acquisition is "exchange" based on "…<a href="http://bible.cc/ruth/4-7.htm">this was a custom in Israel… a man would give his shoe to the other</a>…".  The object used for exchange must be a utensil. Usually the seller pulls a kerchief from the hand of the buyer, after which the object is sold, and the buyer is obligated to pay.</div>

Although paying the money <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/talmud_daily/12884.html">can't finalize a sale</a>, can money be used for "exchange?" To signify the "exchange," one would announce it, or the coin would be returned. No! Even a golden coin can be removed from circulation, loosing value, which is fundamentally different from a utensil like a shoe.</div>
