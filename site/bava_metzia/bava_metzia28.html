From: "...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/22-2.htm">and it (the lost object) will remain with you <span style="font-weight: bold;">until</span> your brother seeks it out</a>...". Since you can't return it <span style="font-weight: bold;">before</span> he asks (seeks) for it, the word "seek" must mean something else - that you must seek out whether he is a liar or not by the use of identifying marks.<br />
<br />
Thus a lost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_%28divorce_document%29">Get</a> can be returned if the owner names a sign, such as a hole next to a specific letter.<br />
<br />
During the time of the Temple, the finder would announce his find three times, on Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot, but now it is announced in the neighborhood.
