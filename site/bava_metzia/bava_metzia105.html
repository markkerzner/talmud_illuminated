In that case, we do not listen to him, for the landowner can reply, "If your lease expires and you don't renew it, the field will grow weeds for me."</span></div>

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">If a sharecropper leases a field from his fellow and it does not produce a substantial crop, he wants to abandon working the field. If there is enough growing in it to produce a heap, he is obligated to care for it. Rabbi Yehudah says, "What kind of limit is a heap? Rather, if there is enough for sowing the field again."</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Art: Haystack, Pontoise by Camille Pissarro</span></div>
