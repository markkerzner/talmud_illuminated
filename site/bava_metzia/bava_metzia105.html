<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">If a tenant-farmer leased a field from his fellow but did not want to weed it and said to the landowner, "What concern is it of yours, since I am committed to giving you your full rental?" - we do not listen to him, for the landowner can reply, "If you lease expired and you don't renew it, the field will grow weeds for me."</span></div>
