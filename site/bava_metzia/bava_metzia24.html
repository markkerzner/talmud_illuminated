He asked Shmuel, "If one found a purse here, what is the law?" Shmuel said, "It belongs to the finder." Many people pass by here, and one is likely to take it. Thus, the owner despairs.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Rav Yehudah continued, "If a Jew comes and gives an identifying mark for it, what is the law?" Shmuel said, "He is obligated to return it." How can both rulings be true?
