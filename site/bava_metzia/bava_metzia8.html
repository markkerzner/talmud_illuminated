This is true even though he deprives other potential finders of the object. It can be proved from <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/talmud_daily/2149.html">the case of two people who have found a garment</a>.<br />
<br />
There, each one is holding his end of the garment, and should his fellow drop it, the garment would partially rest on the floor, which would mean that our claimant has yet to acquire it since complete lifting is required. We must conclude that when they lift the garment, both intend to help the other acquire it.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Maidens Picking Flowers by a Stream [Study] by John William Waterhouse</div>
