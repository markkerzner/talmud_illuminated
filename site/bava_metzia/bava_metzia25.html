Examples include produce in a vessel, or a vessel as is, homemade loaves of bread, jugs of wine, and jugs of oil – these used to have individual seals. </div><div><br /></div><div>If one found behind a wall – which provides partial protection - young pigeons that were tied, he should not touch them. Perhaps a person put them there, and if the finder takes them and announces them, the owner may not have signs to claim them.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a88588/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></div>
