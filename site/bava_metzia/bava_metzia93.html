He may also stipulate this for his adult children and his wife, since they have understanding, but not for his minor children or his animals.<br /><br />Of <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/05/bava-metzia-34-four-custodians.html">the four custodians</a>,  an unpaid custodian swears with regard to every mishap and is then not liable, the borrower pays for everything, and the paid custodian and the renter swear if an animal broke a limb, was captured, or died of natural causes.</span>
