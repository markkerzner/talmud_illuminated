<div>
If one deposits produce with his fellow, even if it is becoming ruined due to mice or spoilage, the custodian may not sell it. </div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
One reason is that a person prefers a measure of his own produce - for which he toiled - to nine measures of his fellow's produce which can be bought. That is an exaggeration, but if it is not spoiling faster than normal, it should not be sold. </div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Another explanation is that he may have designated it as tithes for his other produce, and he may come to eat non-tithed produce. Knowing that the produce is not sold, the owner is even more likely to do this designation.</div>
