Rabbah bar bar Chanan took their cloaks as payment.<br /><br />The porters went to the court of Rav and told him about it. Rav said to Rabbah bar bar Chanan, "Give them back their cloaks." "Is that the law?" - he asked. "Yes," - said Rav, quoting from Proverbs, "<a href="http://bible.cc/proverbs/2-20.htm">In order that you go on the path of good people</a>..."<br /><br />They said to Rav, "We are poor people, and we labored the entire day; we are starving and have nothing to eat." Rav said to Rabbah bar bar Chanan, "Pay them their fee." "Is that the law?" - he asked. "Yes," - said Rav, quoting the end of the phrase, "...and keep the ways of the righteous."</span>
