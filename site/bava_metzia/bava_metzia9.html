It is implied that he had it in mind when he picked it up, not that he changed his mind later.</div><div><br /></div><div>If, however, after he had given it to the rider, he said "I acquired it first," he has said nothing, that is, his claim is dismissed and the rider may keep it.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a87479/go">Test your knoweldge of the daf</a></div>
