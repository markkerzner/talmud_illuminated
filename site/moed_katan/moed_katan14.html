Why is this? By prohibiting to cut hair on the intermediate days of the festival, the Sages made sure that people come to the first day of Holidays completely prepared and with a haircut done. 
<br />
<br />
However, there are exceptions. These include, for example, one who arrived from overseas on the holiday weekdays and who therefore could not take a haircut on a trip, one who was released from prison, one who was excommunicated and whose ban was now released. 
<br />
<br />
Likewise, mourners are forbidden to cut their hair, but in the special situations listed above they are allowed to do it. What is the connection between joy and mourning, and why are their laws so similar? - From the phrase "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3205.htm">You changed our joy to mourning</a>" we see that this change is easy, and it must be that the two states share similarities. Others say that a person who is over-joyful should be reminded that he, too, will die.

<br />
One is allowed to cut infant's hair on a holiday weekday. Since this child was previously unable to do so, being in his mother's tummy - "there is no prison more than that" rule applies.<br />
