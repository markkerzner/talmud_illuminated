<br />
<br />
If a woman checks herself for blood before and after marital relations, then this check also counts to prevent retroactive food impurity. If the teacher did not tells us this rule, we could have thought that before relations she is rushing "to her house," that is, to be with her husband, and won't inspect properly. After relations, we could have thought that a small drop of blood the size of a mustard seed may be covered by semen. Therefore, the teacher had to tell us both cases.
