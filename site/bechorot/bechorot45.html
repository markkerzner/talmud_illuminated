<h1>Bechorot 45 - Blemishes of Legs and Hands of a Kohen</h1>

<br />
One who has extra digits in his hands and feet, that is, six on each  - Rabbi Yehudah declares him fit, but the Sages say that he is unfit. They argue about a phrase in Samuel, "There was another war, and there was a man of huge stature, with six fingers on his hands and feet." The Sages consider these words a shame, but Rabbi Yehudah considers them a praise.
<br />
<br />
A left-handed Kohen cannot serve in the Temple because he lacks a legally recognized right hand, and many services require it. An ambidexterous Kohen - Rabbi Yehudah the Prince assumes that this is due to the weakness in the right hand, which makes it a blemish, but the Sages say that it is his left hand that grew unusually strong, thus, he is fit.
