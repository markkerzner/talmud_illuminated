Rabbi Shimon says that he does not, since it is highly unusual for people to return once they left for Shabbat - with the exception of a parent visiting his or her daughter-in-law, because then if there is a quarrel, it has a tendency to continue.
<br />
<br />
If there is water, for example, in a cistern, between two courtyards, then when the residents of one courtyard draw water, they are drawing from the other courtyard - because water always mixes - and in the absence of a common eruv, it is prohibited. What is to be done? They must put up a separation, a wall within a cistern. Even an incomplete wall, which only partially shows up and is partially submerged in water, is sufficient - provided that it is ten handbreadths high. There are multiple opinions on the exact position of this separating wall, but all agree that this is a leniency that the Sages gave to the water and that a partial "hanging" separation will not suffice on dry land.
