<h1>Eruvin 89 - All the roofs</h1>
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UEeCLUBkrzc/UbT_gGyFY-I/AAAAAAAANeo/-EHfMmHmIJ4/s1600/Blue+Roofs+Rouen+by+Paul+Gauguin+(1848-1903+).jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-UEeCLUBkrzc/UbT_gGyFY-I/AAAAAAAANeo/-EHfMmHmIJ4/s320/Blue+Roofs+Rouen+by+Paul+Gauguin+(1848-1903+).jpg" width="262" /></a>Although one cannot carry from a courtyard to a courtyard on Shabbat without an eruv (common food), all roofs of the houses are considered one domain, and one can freely carry there, with one limitation only: one roof should not be higher or lower than ten hand-breadths from the other - these are the words of Rabbi Meir. The Sages disagree and say that just as all courtyards are separate areas, so too all roofs are separate areas.
<br />
<br />
We can understand the Sages, but Rabbi Meir's position seems inconsistent: if all roofs are one area, then what does the difference in height of ten hand-breadths matter? - Rabbi Meir is concerned that if people get used to stepping up and down the roofs, they may come to use a mound ten hand-breadths high, situated in a street, for their needs - and there it would clearly be not allowed.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Shimon gives a new rule which changes our understanding of the laws of eruv so far: all roofs - and even all courtyards - combine together into one area, and one can carry there - talking about objects which started Shabbat in a courtyard but not in a house. Thus, if an object was in a house at the beginning of Shabbat, the laws and limitations of eruv apply to it. But if it was in a courtyard, then one can take it to another courtyard even without an eruv.
