The result is that we can reason about their laws using the same deductions as in the Torah.
<br />
<br />
For example, there are a few cases in the Torah where one who carries an item indirectly, without touching it, nevertheless becomes ritually impure, such as meat of a non-kosher animal or a kosher one that was killed but not by slaughter. How do we know that the Sages applied the same law to one who carries an idol? - Explains Rabbi Akiva, since Isaiah says that in the future the Jews will "Cast the idols away as other objects that engender impurity, and you will say to them - Go!" - therefore we know that the Sages established ritual impurity for one who carries an idol. 
<br />
<br />
What else can we learn from the comparison of an idol to, for example, a "<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/definition-of-term-zav.html">zav</a>" - man who had a special type of emission? - That just as his impurity does not apply to separate members of his body, so too it does not apply to pieces of an idol.
