<h1>Shabbat 24 - Shabbat or Hanukkah, which is more important?</h1>
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SoX7MHdQ_QU/UI3JtwrcDEI/AAAAAAAALTU/v7XJLmtSTsQ/s1600/Eduard+Von+Grutzner+-+A+Good+Vintage.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SoX7MHdQ_QU/UI3JtwrcDEI/AAAAAAAALTU/v7XJLmtSTsQ/s320/Eduard+Von+Grutzner+-+A+Good+Vintage.jpg" width="244" /></a>Rava said the following: "It is obvious to me that if a poor person has money for only one light, Shabbat or Hanukkah, he should purchase oil for Shabbat, because it brings peace to his house: sitting in the dark on Friday night would distress his household." He then asked, "If one has a choice between Hanukkah light and wine for the sanctification (Kiddush) on Shabbat, which should he choose? Do we say that Shabbat comes first, because of the rule that something that is more frequent takes precedence? Or do we say that Hanukkah light is more important, because it publicizes the miracle?" He then resolved it himself: one should buy oil for one Hanukkah light, which is sufficient to publicize the miracle, and spend the rest on wine.
<br />
<br />
Rav Huna gave a series of omens. One who is habitual to light Shabbat and Hanukkah candles will merit children who are Torah scholars, (based on "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2806.htm">mitzvah is lamp and Torah is light</a>"). One who is careful with the mezuzah will merit a beautiful residence. One who is careful about tzitzit will merit a beautiful garment. One who is careful to say the Shabbat Kiddush on wine will merit to fill many kegs of wine.
