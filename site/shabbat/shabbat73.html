<h1>Shabbat 73 - Thirty nine, the complete list</h1>

This is derived from the phrase of "Build My Temple, but stop the work and observe Shabbat." It also includes preparatory activities.
<br />
<br />
Outside the Temple, the list includes other activities similar to the main ones. For this reason, the primary thirty-nine designate groups rather than specific types of work. The list begins with eleven labors necessary for baking bread: sowing, plowing, reaping, gathering (sheaves) together, threshing, winnowing, selecting (rock out of grain), grinding, sifting, kneading, and baking.
<br />
<br />
Then come the thirteen labors involved in the preparation of clothing: shearing wool, whitening it, disentangling it, dyeing, spinning, mounting the warp, setting two neddles on the loom, weaving at least two threads, removing threads in order to re-weave, tying a knot and untying a knot, sewing two stitches and tearing in order to sew another two stitches.
<br />
<br />
Hides and writing: trapping a deer, slaughtering it, skinning it, salting it, tanning its hide, smoothing, cutting it, writing at least two letters and erasing in order to write another two letters.
<br />
<br />
Finally, six more labors: building and demolishing, extinguishing and kindling, adding a finishing touch to his work (such as striking the final blow with the hammer), and carrying within the public domain or from a domain to another domain.
