We learn from his example that one should dress up for Shabbat, prayer, and Torah study.

Torah scholar who wears soiled garments makes people dislike the Torah and is liable to a punishment. So too, it is a disgrace for a Torah scholar to go out in patched shoes. But Rab Acha bar Chanina did go out wearing patched shows!? - We mean, patches on patches, but one level of patches is allowed.

<br />
Which Torah scholar can be appointed a leader over a community? - One whom you can ask any question in learning, even in the areas rarely studied. For such a scholar the community has the obligation to provide  - but how much? - only for bread but not for luxuries.

Before the calendar was fixed, Yom Kippur could fall on Friday. In this case Rabbi Ishmael permits to fold garments on Yom Kippur in preparation for Shabbat. If Yom Kippur falls on Sunday, one can burn Shabbat offerings in the Temple on the Yom Kippur day, because Yom Kippur has lesser sanctity than Shabbat. However, Rabbi Akiva considers the two days to be of equal strenght, and fordibs preparing on one for the other. Both base their proof on the phrase from the Torah, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=28#P4585">Bring Shabbat offering on its own Shabbat</a>," but understand it differently.
