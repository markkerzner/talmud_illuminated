<h1>Arachin 6 - Money for Charity</h1>
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-V-ULiyQzmoM/TxeIN6Y9mUI/AAAAAAAAIeg/hy6j_Clsas8/s1600/Camille+Pissarro+-+Charity.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-V-ULiyQzmoM/TxeIN6Y9mUI/AAAAAAAAIeg/hy6j_Clsas8/s320/Camille+Pissarro+-+Charity.jpg" width="262" /></a>If an idolater separated a Kohen's portion (terumah) from his grain, saying "I wanted to do what Jews do" - this is a valid. However, if he said nothing, then perhaps he meant for the Temple, and since there is no Temple, it has to be hidden. In general, any "consecration for the Temple" today creates a similar problem.
<br />
<br />
Money designated for charity is similar to a vow: just as a vow has to be fulfilled in its due time, so charity has to be paid; if the time was not specified, it means right away. However, it is not similar to Temple consecration: one can use designated coins, and then repay. One who collects charity - money or objects -from people should be careful to use it according to their designation, unless he knows that they would not mind if he uses it for a different good cause.
<br />
<br />
One who is in the throes of death and one who is going out to be executed by court cannot be a subject of any monetary vow. But the condemned should at least have a symbolic value!? - Since there is not redemption for a murderer, by analogy there is none for the condemned one.
