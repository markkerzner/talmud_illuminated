When the thirtieth day arrives, the second betrothal remains effective and thus prevents the first one from going into effect.<br />
<br />
If one says to a woman, “You are betrothed to me on condition that I will give you two hundred silver coins (about $10,000) – she is betrothed to him, provided that he pays.
