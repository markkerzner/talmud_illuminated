Taanit 20 – Better to be pliable like a reed and not hard like a cedar

In analyzing <a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1504.htm">this phrase from Amos</a>, Rav Yehudah said – it is a bad sign for both.
<br />
<br />
However, on other occasions Rav Yehudah found good signs within bad ones. For example, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3201.htm">Jerusalem will be like a widow</a>.” – but not really a widow, rather, like a woman whose husband went overseas but plans to come back. Another case: prophet Achiya cursed Israel that God will smite it like a reed. And yet, reeds straightens out after a storm. On the other hand, Bilam blessed them to be like a tall cedar that can withstand a strong wind. A strong wind – yes, but not a hurricane, when cedar becomes uprooted. Thus, it is better to be pliable like a reed and not hard like a cedar. Moreover, the reed merited that a pen is made of it, to write books.

Rabbi Elazar son of Rabbi Shimon was going home from the yeshiva, on a donkey, and he was happy about the Torah that he had learned. A man who was very ugly greeted him, but he replied, “How ugly is that man!” The man said, “Go back to the craftsman who made me and complain.” Rabbi Elazar immediately got down from the donkey and started begging forgiveness, but the man was adamant. Only when the people of the town to which they were going interceded, did the man grant forgiveness. Rabbi Elazar directed to the study hall, and his first lesson was, “A person should be pliable as a reed and not hard as a cedar.”
