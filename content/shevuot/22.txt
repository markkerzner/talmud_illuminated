Shevuot 22 – Oath Not To Eat

<br />
If one swore, “An oath that I will not eat,” and then he ate and drank, he is liable to only one offering. But if one swore, “An oath that I will not eat and that I will not drink,” and then he ate and drank, he is liable to two offerings.<br />
<br />
If one swore, “An oath that I will not eat,” and then he ate prohibited foods, such as animals or foul that were not slaughtered correctly, unkosher fish, seals, frogs, flies, bees, mosquitoes – he is liable. Rabbi Shimon exempts him, because he swore to something to which he is already obligated, and his new oath did not take effect.<br />
