However, building an oven or a stove is permitted. Even though doing this is a few steps removed from the food preparation for the holidays, this is an exception, because of the importance of enjoying the holiday.

<br />
Rava permitted a few thing on the holiday weekday, but depending upon intentions. For example, if one levels the mounds of rocks and earth in his field, then, if he is doing it to prepare a threshing floor – it is permitted (because it is for a festival need), but if he is doing it to prepare for cultivation (and he won't be able to enjoy the fruit of his labor this holiday), it is forbidden. How do we know what he has in mind? By the size of the mound that he leaves over.
<br />
<br />
Another example: one is cutting branches from a palm tree. If it is to feed his animals – it is allowed, but if it is to promote the growth of the tree – then it is forbidden. How do we know? – If he cuts from one side only – it is for the animals. But if he is careful to cut if from all sides – he is doing this for the tree.
