For instance, one cannot draw water for his field, neither from water wells nor from pools of rainwater.
<br />
<br />
Now, we understand that drawing water from a well, using a pail, requires exertion. However, what's the problem with the pool of rainwater? It should be pretty easy to trace a path for the water with one's foot, and let the water flow from the pool into the field. – The Sages simply prohibited both together, so that people would not make the wrong deduction. Others say, the pool of rainwater may eventually dry out and require a pail. The argue about whether water may or may not dry out.
<br />
<br />
There is one exception for the above rules: one may bring up (water with a pail) for the vegetables, in order to eat them on the Holidays. Ravina and Rabbah were traveling along the road on a certain holiday weekday, and they saw a man who was drawing water with a pail and watering his vegetable patch. Rabbah said to Ravina, “Let's excommunicate him for violating the law!” Ravina answered, “but we may draw up for vegetables in order to eat them.” Rabbah counters, “Is that how you understand 'bring up'? No! - This means, thinning out the vegetables, by 'bringing up' the extra ones, which don't let the others to grow.” Ravina showed him an example where “bringing up” meant bringing up water, and Rabbah said, “I agree with your proof and retract my opinion.”
