Moed Katan 2 – Limiting the work

On a Holiday (Yom Tov) work is completely prohibited. The five intermediate days, between the first and the last Yom Tov are called "holiday weekdays". On these days work is permitted, but it is limited - thus adding to the enjoyment of the holidays.<br />
<br />
What are these limitations, and what kind of work should not be done on holiday weekdays? In general, only work which, if not done, leads to losses – only such work is allowed. Moreover, even when saving his crop from ruin, one cannot do work which required exertion.<br />
<br />
Take, for example, a field. If this field is normally irrigated by rains, then one should not water it during the holiday weekdays. The crop in this field can survive without his additional water, so watering it would only lead to additional growth, and that is not reason enough to work. On the other hand, if his field is high up in the mountains, and it depends on his watering of it, and without this his crop would be ruined, he is permitted to water it.<br />
<br />
Even so, one cannot work too hard. He can use a spring and divert its water to his field. He cannot, however, draw water from a well, because this requires much more exertion.<br />
<br />
The two additional limitations are the view of Rabbi Yehudah. There are, however, other views, which take away both of the "preventing loss" and "not working too much" limitations for the holiday weekdays - and that is the view of Rabbi Meir.<br />
