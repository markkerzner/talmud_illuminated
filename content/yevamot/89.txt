What is the logic?
<br />
<br />
We understand that she needs a Get from the first husband, since, as is turned out, she is still married to him. But the second one – technically their betrothal did not even take effect! – This was instituted by the Sages to prevent a mistake: the onlookers might think she was properly married to the second husband, and now leaves him without a Get – and therefore conclude that the Get is generally unnecessary. 
<br />
<br />
But take a similar case where she only got engaged, not married to the second husband – there she can return to the first husband, and the Get from the second one is not required. Why not!? – People might also make a mistake and think that one can re-marry his wife after she was divorced and married to someone in the interim. That, actually, is a good objection. The fine distinction, however, is that where she was only engaged – no transgression took place – and although people might make an mistake, the Sages did not penalize her; where she got married, they lived together unlawfully, and they did impose a penalty.
<br />
<br />
Moreover, any child she has from one of the two husbands is considered illegitimate (mamzer). Again, we understand this about the second husband, but the first? – The Talmud then discussed if the Sages really have the power to declare a kosher child a mamzer, as a penalty.
