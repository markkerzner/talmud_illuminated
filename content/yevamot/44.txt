<br />
This ruling, however, raises many questions. The Torah, in describing yibum, said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=25#P5547">And the Sages of his city will summon him and speak to him</a>.” We understand that they give him appropriate advice. If he was old and she – young, they would tell him, “What do you have in common with such a young woman? Find somebody more appropriate for your age, and don't bring strife in your house.” They would say the same if the ages were reversed.<br />
<br />
Since most people will have difficulty supporting four wives, how do they let him do it in this case? – We must answer that we are dealing with a situation where he has the means. But if so, what is the novelty? It is obvious! – The ruling gives him good advice: he should not take more than four wives to fulfill the marital obligation with each one at least once a month.
<br />
<br />
If one re-marries his ex-wife, who married someone else in the interim, the child is a mamzer. That is only the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, but the Sages say that a mamzer is born only through a liaison with a married woman or a similar severe transgression. All agree, however, about another situation.&nbsp;If one divorced his wife and married any of her forbidden relatives, the child is indeed a mamzer. Regarding in-law relationships, a divorcée is like a wife.
