What is his logic? – The Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=18#P4281">Speak to the Levites and say to them, 'When you take … tithe.'</a>”<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah says that the tithe goes to the Kohanim. How could he exclude the Levites altogether? – He didn't, he meant “Also to the Kohanim.” And what is his logic? – There are twenty-four places where the Kohanim are called Levites, because they in fact come from the same family: Aaron, the progenitor of all the Kohanim, comes from the tribe of Levy.
<br />
<br />
If so, how can Rabbi Akiva argue that the tithe should not be given to the Kohanim? – He says that the tithe is special, because one can eat it “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=4&amp;CHAPTER=18#P4286,">anywhere</a>,” whereas the Kohen cannot eat it in a cemetery – because he cannot go to the cemetery at all! What would Rabbi Elazar answer now? – He says that this teaches a different law, namely, that the tithe can be eaten in any state, even being ritually impure.

<br />
Later, when the Second Temple was being build, the Sages penalized the Levites and took the tithe away from them and gave it to the Kohanim – because the Levites did not come back to build the Temple; some say, it was done for the benefit of poor Kohanim.
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah had a garden from which he was collecting the tithe. Rabbi Akiva turned the garden's entrance into a cemetery, so that Rabbi Elazar (who was a Kohen) would be prevented from taking the tithe. Rabbi Elazar said, “Akiva is with his shepherd's sack, but I will survive anyway.” (He was very wealthy).
