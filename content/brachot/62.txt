Brachot 62 - Bedside Manners (Blessings)
<p>The Talmud lists various laws of behavior in a latrine. Ben Azzai told how he once entered after Rabbi Akiva into the latrine and what three rules he learned by observing him. Rabbi Yehudah said to him: "Did you then act so brazenly towards your teacher?!" Ben Azzai replied, "His behavior is Torah, and I must study it."</p><p>Rav Kahana once hid under the bed of his teacher, Rav. He wanted to observe Rav's actual practice in fulfilling the laws of marital relations. He heard how Rav first spoke idle words with his wife, then laughed with her, and then fulfilled his marital obligations. From beneath the bed, he said, "The teacher's mouth is like one's who never tasted the dish!" Rav said to him, "Kahana, are you here?! Go out, for it is not proper (for you to be here)." Rav Kahana replied, "Your behavior is Torah, and I must study it!"</p>
