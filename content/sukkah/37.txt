Rabbi Yehudah even considers this a necessary requirement: the branches must be bound together. Thus, the material you use to tie it together is part of the mitzvah, and if so, it must be one of the same four species that you are tying – otherwise you are adding to a mitzvah and taking together five species, and not four, and the Torah said, “Do not add to the mitzvot or subtract from them.”
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Meir says that the binding is not strictly required; thus, it is not a mitzvah, and can be of any material. In fact, the important people of Jerusalem were using golden threads. What does Rabbi Yehudah answer? That the gold was on top of the branches, for beautification, but the real binding was done with one of the four species, most likely a luval leaf. 
<br />
<br />
Similarly, Rabbi Yehudah permits to make sukkah only out of the same four species. His logic? Here it is: sukkah is more stringent than the lulav bunch, since it applies both by day and by night, whereas lulav – only by day. Therefore, if the lulav bunch can have only on of the four species, then certainly the sukkah must be made of the same materials. And what did the Sages answer? That this logic, seemingly strict, is in fact lenient, and thus does not apply. For, if he does not have the right materials, he can ignore the sukkah and go live at home – which is an unacceptable lenience; thus, the logic is incorrect.
