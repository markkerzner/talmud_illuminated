It served as a musical accompaniment before the drawing of the water for libation. Since it was not played on Shabbat or Festivals, sometimes it worked out to five days of flute playing and sometimes six.<div><br /></div><div>But why was it not played on Shabbat? Indeed, there is an opinion that it was played on Shabbat. It all depends on whether the instrumental part is essential - and then flute music qualifies as Temple service, which should be done on Shabbat. Or whether the vocal part is essential - and then the flute is not played on Shabbat.</div><div><br /></div><div>If we believe that the essence of the Temple musical service is instrumental, we can derive other laws from it. For example, the flute used in Moses' times was made of wood (based on the assumption that the wooden flute has the sweetest sound).&nbsp; From here, it follows that all service vessels, such as the menorah, can be made of wood. Others would argue that the flute of Moses had to be made of wood and could not be made of metal. They say that you cannot take a situation where you are forced to do something and derive that you have to do it in other situations. Which logic is more correct? It is one of the unresolved questions in the Talmud.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Boy playing the Flute by Judith Leyster</div>
