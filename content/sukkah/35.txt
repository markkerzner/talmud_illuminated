Etrog (citron) is one of the species in the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/03/sukkah-34-branches.html">Sukkot bunch</a>. However, since it is special in that it has taste and smell, the requirements for it are more strict. For example, the laws of orlah (fruit that are not eaten for the first three years) apply to it, and thus an etrog in the first three years is invalid. Technically, this is because by law it will be burned, and thus is considered to have zero size even now.<br />
<br />
If the etrog is the priest's portion (terumah) and is ritually impure – it is invalid, because one cannot eat it. If it is the priest's portion and it is pure – then one should not take it, so that he does not make it impure, but if he does – it is valid.
<br />
<br />
But how do we know that “etrog” is citron, in the first place? Since the Torah calls it “beautiful tree-fruit,” we understand that it comes from such special tree whose branches also have the taste of its fruit – and that is citron. But perhaps it is pepper? - No, that could not be: if you take just one pepper, it is too small. And if you take two or three – the Torah said to take one fruit, and not two or three. Thus it must be citron.
