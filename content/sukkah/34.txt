One waves them in all six directions. The four types of branches or fruit have similar laws, but the teacher enumerates them separately because of some differences between them. One should preferably procure the best.
<br />
<br />
The willow branch – if it is stolen – is invalid. That is because the Torah said, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=23#P3440">Take for yourself</a>,” which means – it should be yours, not stolen. If the willow branch is dried out, it is also invalid, because it is no longer beautiful.
<br />
<br />
If one cuts off a branch from a tree that was grown for worshiping it – this is invalid, because by law it should be burned, and therefore even now it is regarded as having zero dimensions, whereas a certain minimal size is required. However, if it only withered, or a portion of its leaves fell off, it remains valid. 
<br />
<br />
Earlier we mentioned how many of each type is required. However, Rabbi Akiva has a different logic: just as citron and palm branch are one, so too willow and myrtle must also be one. What about the first teacher? – He derives the required numbers from the spelling of their names.
