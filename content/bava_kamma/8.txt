This question is only relevant to Rabbi Akiva's opinion, because Rabbi Ishmael unambiguously stated that they assess in terms of the damaged party's lands. What is the answer?<br />

From a ruling about a damager possessing only average and inferior land, do we see that we assess relative to the world at large? No! He had superior land but sold it.
