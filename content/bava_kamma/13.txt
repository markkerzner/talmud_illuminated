Thus, if the identity of the damaging ox is unclear, and the owners of the two suspect oxen each blame the other, one saying, "It was your ox that damaged," while the other one saying, "No, it was your ox that damaged" - the damaged party cannot collect from  either owner.<br />

One is liable for damage done anywhere except for premises reserved exclusively for the damager. If the damage occurs on his premises, the damager can ask, "What was your ox doing on my premises?"<div><br /></div><div>Art: Cattle Against A Landscape by W. J. Chapman</div>
