<ul>
<li>One who breaches a wall before his fellow's animal (the animal exited its enclosure and fled);</li>
<li>One who bends his fellow's standing grain toward a fire (the fire then reached the grain with the aid of an unusually strong wind);</li>
<li>One who hires false witnesses to testify (on behalf of his fellow);</li>
<li>One who knows testimony beneficial to his fellow but does not testify on his behalf.</li>
</ul>
