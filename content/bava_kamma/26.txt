By grouping the “blinding” and “breaking utensils,” this ruling teaches that just as in the case of utensils, he pays for the actual damage <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-18.htm">but not the</a> &nbsp;“four things” - pain, healing, unemployment, and humiliation - so too if he blinded the eye of his fellow unintentionally, he pays for the actual damages but not the “four things.”</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Blind Beggar And His Boy by Jusepe de Ribera</div>
