<div>
If the ox of a competent person gored the ox of a deaf-mute from birth, deranged, or a minor, the owner is liable, but in the reverse situation the owner is exempt.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
If the ox of an incompetent person gored, the court appoints an agent to watch over the ox, and then accepts testimony in the presence of the agent. If the minor becomes an adult, Rabbi Meir says that the goring ox reverts to innocence, but Rabbi Yehudah says it remains warned.</div>

<div>
Ordinarily, an ox that kills a man is put to death, but if an ox of the arena kills, it it not liable.</div>
