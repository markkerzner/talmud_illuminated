Bava Kamma 105 - Flaky Humans
<p><a href="https://talmudilluminated.com/bava_kamma/bava_kamma104.html" target="_blank">We remember</a> that one who robs his fellow of money, either by stealing, robbing, or not returning something deposited with him - <b>and swears that he did not do it</b> - needs to fix it in a special way. He has to find the victim, restore what he stole, add one-fifth, and bring a guilt-offering to the Temple.</p><p>What if he returned the principal but not the fifth and now swears that he returned the fifth? If he then confesses that he again took a false oath, he must restore the amount, add one-fifth, and bring another guilt sacrifice. This process can continue until the principal amount is reduced to less than a prutah (about five cents.)</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
