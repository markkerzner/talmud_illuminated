<br />
If combined, can the two teach liability for fire? Ox has the intent to damage, whereas fire does not. However a man is liable even for damage which he inflicts while sleeping. Thus, the intent to damage is not essential.<br />
<br />
Man is liable for four damage payments, but fire for just one. However, the ox disproves that, since it is also liable for just one payment.<br />
<br />
Man and ox are alive, and fire is not, thus liability for fire had to be mentioned in the Torah.
