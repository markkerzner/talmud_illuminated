<span style="font-size: medium;">If one gave an article to craftsmen to fix, and they ruined it, they are liable to pay. If a builder contracted to demolish a wall and damaged passersby â€“ he, and not the homeowner, is liable. If he was demolishing from one side and it fell, against his best estimate, from the other side, he is not liable. But if it fell because of his blow, he is liable.<br />
<br />
An expert slaughterer who was given an animal to slaughter for a fee and bungled by slaughtering it improperly is liable to pay the animal's owner. Therefore, one should give him money before he slaughters the animal.<br />
