They prohibited raising small domesticated animals, such as sheep and goats, in Israel - since they tend to wander off for grazing and destroy the vegetation in the peoples' fields.</div>

<div>
It is allowed to keep sheep and goats needed as sacrifices for 30 days before festivals. Butchers have similar allowances. It is not prohibited to raise large domesticated animals like cows in Israel because it is hard to import them.</div>
