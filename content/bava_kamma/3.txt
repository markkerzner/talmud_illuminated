<br />
Eating (tooth) is unique in that the animal's intent is for self-gratification; its subcategories include an animal scratching against the wall or soiling fruit by frolicking on it.<br />
<br />
Do subcategories have the same laws as the main damages? Mostly yes, except in a case where a cow was walking, and a pebble shot from under its foot and broke vessels, for which the owner pays only half the damages.<div><br /></div><div>Art:&nbsp;A Short-Horned Heifer, Engraved By William Ward Dartington</div>
