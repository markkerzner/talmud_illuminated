However, this veto power only lasts for one day, after which the  vow becomes valid like any other vow. Similarly, if a married woman makes a vow, her husband has veto power for one day.
<br />
<br />
If a young girl is engaged (this is a complete engagement, requiring a proper divorce Get) for dissolution) but not living with her husband yet, then both the husband and the father have the veto power, which they would exercise jointly. 
<br />
<br />
What happens if a girl in this situation took a vow, then divorced, or her husband died, and then she got engaged again on the same day? The answer does not change even if she divorced and got engaged a hundred times on this day – her father and her last-in-row husband can jointly cancel her vow during this day.
<br />
<br />
We see thus that the veto power does not go over to the father on the death of the husband, but rather the father and the last-in-row husband can jointly cancel the vow; as long as the girl was not fully married, she remains in part under the jurisdiction of her father.
