Shabbat 131 – Violating Shabbat to do a mitzvah

Actually, Rabbi Eliezer allows this for most other mitzvot, with only two exception: tying a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzitzit">tzitzit</a> on his garment and putting a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezuzah">mezuzah</a> on his door. Why are these the exceptions? – Even though it is true that his garment may need a tzitzit, on Shabbat he may renounce the ownership of his garment or his house altogether, and thus temporarily avoid doing the mitzvah. 
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Eliezer allows to go and cut his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lulav">lulav</a> on Shabbat, and to construct a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkah">sukkah</a> on Shabbat, in preparation for the holiday on Sunday – because the lulav must be taken “on that day,” and so also the sukkah must entered “on that day.” Granted, but why do we need to learn this law twice? The Torah should have taught us one of them, and we would derive the other!? – No, we can't do that. Lulav is special, because it requries three more species of plant to go with it, so we cannot learn the law of the sukkah from it. In turn, sukkah is special in that it is required both by day and by night, and therefore we cannot learn the law of the lulav from sukkah.
