Shabbat 28 – Wick made of wood

Incidentally, materials coming from a tree, if used to construct a roof over a dead body, do not themselves become ritually impure – again, with the exception of flax.
<br />
<br />
This terse rule can be explained as follows. Ordinarily, flax is not considered wood, but it is called “wood” once, in the book of Joshua, “<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0602.htm">And she brought them up to the roof and hid them in the trees of flax...</a>”. Since flax can be used for a wick, and since it does accept ritual impurity, it had to be mentioned and excluded.
<br />
<br />
The law of the wooden roof not accepting ritual impurity of the dead – although it transmits this impurity to other objects – is derived from the laws of the covering of the Tabernacle. A related  question is the skin of an animal called <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=25#P2198">“tachash,” also translated as “blue processed skin”</a> – was it a kosher animal or not. It had one horn, and therefore should have been kosher, since we <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/07/niddah-51-one-but-not-other-wool-and.html">learned in the tractate Niddah</a> that this is a  sign of a kosher animal. Besides, the ox that Adam brought as a sacrifice, also had one horn, and it definitely was kosher. However, it could be that the unicorn called tachash was a special creature that appeared just once, to provide skins for the Tabernacle (it was multicolored, “&nbsp;joyous&nbsp;in his colors” in Aramaic), but then was hidden again, and its kosher status remains in doubt.
