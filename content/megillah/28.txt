A synagogue that has fallen into ruin and is not used for prayer nevertheless retains its sanctity. One may not eulogize ordinary people there (unless Sages are present, which makes it a  public eulogy). One may not do any kind of work there, such as making ropes or nets, or spreading fruit on its roof.  One should also not use the synagogue as a shortcut.
<br />
<br />
Why is this? – Because of the phrase, “<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=26#P3553">And I will make your sanctuaries desolate.</a>” Thus, even after they are desolate, they are still called “your sanctuaries” and retain their rights. If grass sprouts there, one should not uproot it, in order to inspire grief.
<br />
<br />
Since one cannot enter the synagogue for personal affairs, what is he to do when he needs to call someone out of it? – He should come in and sit down. Then, if he knows certain portions of the Talmud or the Torah, he should recite them. If not, he can ask a child to recite for him what the child learned today. Thus, he has converted his visit from personal to the one for study or for prayer.
