A few readers are called up, depending on how much time people have. For example, on regular weekdays, when people work the most, only three readers are called, but on Shabbat, which has the strictest prohibition of work, seven people read from the Torah.

<br />
Initially, the first reader would say the opening blessing, and the last one – the closing one. Later, when more people started getting in and out of the synagogue during the reading of the Torah, the Sages established that everyone who is called up says both blessings, for otherwise those who attended only a part of the reading would mistakenly think that the reading of the Torah does not need a blessing before or after.

<br />
Everyone who reads in the Torah should be given at least three phrases. This presents another problem: since the Torah is written in small sections, visually delineated from the rest, they should read at least three phrases from the beginning of each section. Otherwise, those going in might mistakenly conclude that the previous reader got only two phrases. The same applies to the end of the section. Therefore, how does one divide the section consisting of five phrases? – He reads three from the beginning, and the next reader repeats the last phrase; thus, both read three phrases. Some say that these precautions only apply to people who are going out. Anyone who is coming in will surely ask, “How come we started two phrases from the beginning? Did the previous reader only get two phrases?”  - and they will explain to him that the reader started from the section before.
