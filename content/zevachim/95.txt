Zevachim 95 – Dirty Garment Left the Courtyard

If it has meanwhile become ritually impure, it must be ripped to loose its impurity, then brought back and laundered.<br />
<br />
Similar law applies to an earthenware utensil, except that if it becomes impure while outside, it cannot be broken – since breaking must be inside. Instead, one punctures a small hole in it, which makes it unusable and leads it to loose its impurity, then brings it into the Courtyard and breaks it there.<br />
<br />
Resh Lakish asked a question – What happens if the robe of the High Priest was spattered with blood, taken outside the Courtyard, and there it became impure. The advice above cannot be applied, because <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/28-32.htm">it is forbidden to tear this robe</a>.  It needs to be brought inside and laundered there, but it is forbidden to do so, because it is impure. One is also not allowed to dip it in a mikva to remove its impurity – because that would be the beginning of washing, and washing can only be done inside the Courtyard. <b><i>Readers are invited to submit their solutions</i></b>.<br />
