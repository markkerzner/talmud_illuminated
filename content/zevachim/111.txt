However, if he performed melikah outside, he is not liable either for that, or for bringing it up. Melikah way of killing outside the Temple is not proper, and it makes the bird unfit for consumption and invalid as a sacrifice.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;"> <br />
If he performed regular kosher slaughter of the bird with a knife and offered it up – he is, contrary to the expectations, liable, because of an additional phrase “<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/17-3.htm">or who will slaughter</a>.”<br />
<br />
We thus find that what makes the bird a valid sacrifice (melikah) inside  makes one not liable if done outside, and what makes one liable (shechitah, or kosher slaughter) outside makes one not liable if done inside.<br />
