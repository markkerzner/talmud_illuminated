Why? – Because it makes one rich. And how do we know that? – Because the Torah said, “They shall bring incense in Your presence,” and right after that, “bless, O God, his resources.” Finally, the fourth and last lot was to select who will take the limbs of the sacrifice from the ramp and bring them to the Altar.

Depending on the festivities and the additional rituals for the occasion, the daily sacrificed could be offered by anywhere from nine to twelve Kohanim, but not less or more than that. The sacrifice itself was divided into nine pieces, and each was carried by another Kohen. On the Shabbat within the festival of Sukkot, there were the following additions: a flask of water to be poured on the Altar -- a special for Sukkot, the two blocks of wood, and the new Bread of Vision.
