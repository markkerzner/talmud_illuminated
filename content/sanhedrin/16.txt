An entire tribe could be judged when all of its members served idols and stand to be stoned, when it has a territorial dispute with another tribe, or we could be are talking about a prince who has committed a capital offense.<br />
<br />
The High Priest is judged by the Great Sanhedrin, according to “...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/18-22.htm%20">and every great matter you will bring to me</a>...”&nbsp; What about an ox of the High Priest, is it judged in the Great or Minor Sanhedrin? - remains unresolved.<br />
<br />
The boundaries of the city of Jerusalem or the Courtyard in the Temple can only be extended with the help of the Great Sanhedrin, and a subverted town – one, most of whose inhabitants served idols – can be so designated only by the Great Sanhedrin. <br />
