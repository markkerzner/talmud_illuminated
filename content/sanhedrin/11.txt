Since twelve lunar months are less than a solar year by eleven days, and since Passover has to be in spring, “<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/16-1.htm">Guard the month of young grain to celebrate Passover</a>...”, an extra month is at times inserted. The judges who decide when to insert a month need to be appointed on the day before the discussion.<br />

Rabbi Meir learned from him. When a woman came to his academy claiming that one of his students betrothed her through cohabitation, Rabbi Meir was the first to give her a Get (divorce), and then all the students followed suit.<br />
