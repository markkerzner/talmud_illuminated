Rosh Hashanah 6 – A promise to charity is immediate

However, charity has a special aspect to it. Whereas a promised sacrifice needs to be brought before one, two, or more Holidays pass – depending upon <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2014/05/rosh-hashanah-3-five-points-of-view.html">which opinion you follow</a> – the obligation to give charity takes effect immediately, and one violates the “do not delay” prohibition by not paying. Why is that? Simply because the obligation to bring a sacrifice is active only when there is a chance to do so, but poor people are found at all times. It is thus not related to any occasion or Festival.
<br />
<br />
What about an heir, does he acquire the “do not delay” obligation from his parent, to bring a sacrifice that he father has designated? On the one hand, the Torah said “when you promise,” and the heir did not make a promise. On the other hand, it also said, “you will bring,” and perhaps this does include the heir. Rabbi Chiya offered an answer: “God will require it from you,” - which means to tell us, "from you, but not from your heir." The heir thus does not acquire the parent's obligation.
