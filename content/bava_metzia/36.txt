<br />
Rabbi Yochanan says that it IS an act of negligence, and that the first custodian is now liable even for unavoidable accidents, for which he was not liable before, because the owner can say to the first custodian, “You are credible to me with an oath, and that second custodian is not.”<br />
<br />
The final law agrees with Rabbi Yochanan.
