The object used for exchange must be a utensil. Usually, the seller pulls a kerchief from the buyer's hand, after which the thing is sold, and the buyer is obligated to pay.</div>

Although paying the money <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/talmud_daily/12884.html">can't finalize a sale</a>, can the money be used for "exchange?" To signify the "exchange," one would announce it, or the coin would be returned. No! Even a golden coin can be removed from circulation, losing value, and that is fundamentally different from a utensil like a shoe.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Three Pairs Of Shoes by Vincent Van Gogh</div>
