Examples include produce in a container or a container as is, homemade loaves of bread, jugs of wine, and jugs of oil – these used to have individual seals.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>If one found young pigeons tied with a rope behind a wall – which provides partial protection - he should not touch them. Perhaps a person put them there, and if the finder takes them and announces them, the owner may not have signs to claim them.</div><div><br /></div><div>Art: Harem Women Feeding Pigeons in a Courtyard by Jean-Leon Gerome</div>
