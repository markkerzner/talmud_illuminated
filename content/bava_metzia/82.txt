If he accidentally slips and breaks the keg, then Rabbi Meir says that whether he is paid or not, he can swear and free himself from liability.</span></div>

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Rabbi Yehudah says that slipping is negligence. Therefore, a paid porter is liable - as any paid custodian - but an unpaid porter is not.</span></div>

<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">And Rabbi Meir? He agrees that stumbling is considered negligence, but since people are usually not careful about it, the Rabbis made a decree that a porter can be absolved through an oath because otherwise, nobody will move a keg of his fellow. He swears that he did not break it deliberately.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Art:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">A Young Venetian Water-Carrier by&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">Ludwig Passini</span></div>
