For example, an elderly person is not required to pick up an  object beneath his dignity.<br /><br />Concerning the areas in which Moses should instruct the Jews, the words "...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/18-20.htm">that they shall do</a>..." refer to maintaining a standard of conduct that goes beyond the letter of the law. Said Rabbi Yochanan: "Jerusalem was destroyed only because Jews didn't go beyond the letter of the law."<br /><br /><div>Art: Old man walking in a rye field by Lauritz Andersen Ring</div>
