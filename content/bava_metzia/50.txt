The law in any particular case depends on three factors: the amount of the fraud, the time that elapses between the transaction, and the time the defrauded party protests.<br /></span><br />
<div>
<span style="font-size: medium;">If the amount of price fraud is a discrepancy of less than 1/6, the sale stands, and all claims are immediately waived. If the amount is precisely 1/6, the buyer can demand a refund. If the amount is more than one-sixth, either party can void the sale.</span></div>

<span style="font-size: medium;">The defrauded party has as much time as it takes to show the purchase to a merchant or his relative for assessment.</span></div>
