<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">The proof is from the case of </span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><a href="https://talmudilluminated.com/bava_kamma/bava_kamma71.html" target="_blank">a son consorting with his mother, who is a harlot</a></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><a href="https://talmudilluminated.com/bava_kamma/bava_kamma71.html" target="_blank">.</a> Since the son is liable to the death penalty for incest, he is not obligated to pay, and the sheep that he gave her should be considered a present, not a payment. Since the Torah forbade that sheep as a sacrifice, he must be legally obligated to pay, only that it is unenforceable in court. So, too, in the case of muzzling.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Art: Grazing Sheep with a Sheperdhess Beyond by&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">Charles Emile Jacque</span></div>
