</div><span style="font-size: medium;">Which is to be followed, a ruling issued by a Sage in the course of learning, or his practical ruling in court?<br />
<br />
Neither. While learning, the Sage may not have considered all aspects of the matter. A practical ruling, on the other hand, may be misunderstood by the observer as to the reason behind it. Rather, the Sage has to declare both that the law agrees with a certain view, and that it is to be followed in practice.<br />
<br />
Is the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/12/bava-batra-130-power-to-change.html">ruling about changes in inheritance</a> true for someone on his deathbed, because of “... <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-16.htm">on the day when he makes his sons inherit</a>...”, or even for a one who is young and healthy? Rebbi said (and some state, ruled in an actual case) that it works for a healthy person also. The two reports disagree on “is theory or practice more important.”<br />
