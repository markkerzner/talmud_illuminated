</div><span style="font-size: medium;">The building of an olive press was generally made solely for that purpose. Hence, the sale of this building includes all non-movable items used in the pressing process. <br />
<br />
One who sells the house of an olive press without specifying what is included in the sale has sold the vat, the crusher (that is used to pre-soften olives), and the “maidens”. These items are automatically sold with the press because they are attached to the building where the press is housed.<br />
<br />
However, he has not sold the boards, the wheel, or the beam. These items are excluded from sale because they are not attached to the building.<br />

If he said, “I am selling you the house of the olive press and all that is contained therein,” he has sold all of these items - but not unrelated items that are merely being stored in the house.<br />
