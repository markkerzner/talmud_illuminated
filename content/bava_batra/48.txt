<br />
What is the reason?<br />
<br />
* Is it because any sale is forced since the seller needs money? - No, it could be different when it is against his will.<br />
* Is it because a recalcitrant husband forced to give a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_%28divorce_document%29">Get</a> is indeed divorced? - This is not valid proof because it is a mitzvah to heed the directive of the Sages.<br />
<br />
Rather, it is derived from the following ruling: if they subjected a </span><span style="font-size: medium;">woman</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> to distress until she agreed to be married, the marriage is valid. This proof stands. However, the Sages later annulled such a marriage: he behaved improperly; therefore, they behaved improperly with him.<br />
