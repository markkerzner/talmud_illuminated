</div><span style="font-size: medium;">If one buys the production of a dovecote from his fellow,&nbsp; he must allow the first pair of doves that is produced to fly with the mother – that is, to remain with her; they are not included in the sale.<br />
<br />
It is the tendency of doves to lay a pair of eggs almost every month of the year. These eggs hatch and produce one male and one female, which themselves begin to mate at the age of two months.<br />
<br />
In order to stay in the dovecote, the mother must have, in addition to her mate, her daughter as a companion. The daughter, too, must have her offspring as companions, since her mother is not company enough. The buyer must, therefore, leave all these pairs and not take them for himself.<br />
