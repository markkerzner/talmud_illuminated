<br />
If someone says to one of them, "Give me back my cloak, which I gave you to repair," he answers, "It never happened." And if the claimant persists, "But I have witnesses who saw it in your possession!" - he retorts, "That cloak which they saw was a different one."<br />
<br />
And if the claimant says, "Produce the cloak to ascertain if it is, in fact, mine," - the craftsman says to him, "I will not produce the cloak because of your unfounded claims, as it would be unfair to the owner."<br />
