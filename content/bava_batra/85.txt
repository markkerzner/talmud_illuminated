</div><span style="font-size: medium;">Rav and Shmuel both said, “A person's container can formalize acquisition for him in any place – except in the public domain.” Rabbi Yochanan and Resh Lakish both said, “Even in the public domain.”<br />
<br />
A person's </span><span style="font-size: medium;">container</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> can act as his courtyard to acquire items that are placed in it, provided that the </span><span style="font-size: medium;">container</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> is placed in a domain where the </span><span style="font-size: medium;">container</span><span style="font-size: medium;">'s owner has the right to place it. Thus a buyer can acquire items in the seller's domain by placing them in his </span><span style="font-size: medium;">container</span><span style="font-size: medium;">, provided that the seller gives him the right to place the </span><span style="font-size: medium;">container</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> there. One can place </span><span style="font-size: medium;">containers</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> in the public domain also – but not keep them there permanently.<br />
<br />
However, they don't argue. The first ruling is dealing with a public thoroughfare, and the second – with the quiet recessed area of the public domain, to which people step to discuss business.<br />
