</div><span style="font-size: medium;">If the original owner merely tells two witnesses, “So-and-so is a thief,” this is not an effective protest. If, however, he says, “So-and-so is a thief, for he has taken possession of my land through an act of theft and tomorrow I shall claim it from him in court,” this is an effective protest. The threat to sue is not really necessary, but this is how people usually conclude their protest.<br />
<br />
If the protester tells the witnesses, “Don't tell the occupant that I lodged a protest,” we assume that he means not to tell him directly, but they may tell others. Thus, this protest is effective. If the witnesses promise on their own, “Not a word of protest will leave our mouths,” there is still a chance that they will reveal it inadvertently. Only if they are told, “Keep this completely confidential,” can they be relied upon to keep it secret.<br />
