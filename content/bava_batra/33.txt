</div><span style="font-size: medium;">A rumor emerged involving Rava Bar Sharshum that he was using land that belonged to orphans. Abaye said to him, “Tell me, what are the circumstances?” <br />
<br />
Rava explained, “I was holding their father's land as security for loan repayment and collecting the harvest. When the loan was thus completely paid, I still kept the land, because their father owed me another loan.”<br />
<br />
“Had I returned the land, I would&nbsp; be able to collect the second loan only with an oath, and it is proper to <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">avoid even truthful oaths</a>.&nbsp; You should believe me on the strength of the 'Why would he lie?' argument, for I could have said a better lie, that I bought that land.”<br />
<br />
Abaye ruled, “The rumor functions as protest and ruins your chazakah, the three years of which count only without protests. Therefore, return the land.”<br />
