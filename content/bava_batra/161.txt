Bava Batra 161 – Preventing Forgery in a “Bound” Document
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S2Mcy62E5LI/AAAAAAAADNc/dOiUegdJH08/s1600-h/John+Turing+-+Still+Life+with+Documents.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/S2Mcy62E5LI/AAAAAAAADNc/dOiUegdJH08/s320/John+Turing+-+Still+Life+with+Documents.jpg" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">In a regular document the witnesses sign immediately at the end of the document's text, thus precluding the possibility of tampering with it.<br />
<br />
In contrast, a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/01/bava-batra-160-document-that-is-folded.html">“bound” document</a> requires that the witnesses sign between each fold. However, this opens a possibility of forgery.<br />
<br />
Should we be concerned that, having the witnesses already signed above, he will write an additional clause at the end of the document, beneficial to him? - No, because words “firm and established” are written at the end of a bound document. <br />
<br />
What if he erases the words “firm and established,” adds to the document, then writes the words “firm and established” again? -&nbsp; Additions do not invalidate the document, but erasures, even certified with “firm and established”, do invalidate it.<br />
