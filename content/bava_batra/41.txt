Bava Batra 41 â€“ Presumption of Ownership Must Be Accompanied by a Claim (Civil)
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/SsWBG-uzoXI/AAAAAAAACoU/j6qTi9aPHuU/s1600-h/Louis+Charles+Moeller+-+A+Notty+Question.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/SsWBG-uzoXI/AAAAAAAACoU/j6qTi9aPHuU/s320/Louis+Charles+Moeller+-+A+Notty+Question.jpg" /></a></div><span style="font-size: medium;">Any chazakah not accompanied by a claim is not a meaningful chazakah and does not entitle the occupant to keep the property. How so?<br />
<br />
If the previous owner said to the occupant, "What are you doing on my property?" - and the occupant replied, "I am here because nobody ever said anything to me," - his chazakah is not meaningful, and he must vacate the property.<br />
<br />
If, however, the occupant replied, "You sold this land to me," "You gave it to me as a gift," "Your father sold it to me," or "Your father gave it to me as a gift," - it is a meaningful chazakah, and the occupant keeps the property. One who comes into a property by inheritance does not require a supporting claim.<br />
