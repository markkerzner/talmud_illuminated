Rav Acha wrote one Torah scroll on calfskin (which is thicker, and thus it is harder to make it ideal size), and it turned out to be a scroll whose height and circumference were the same. The Rabbis cast their eyes on him in disbelief, and he died.</span><div><span style="font-size: 130%;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: 130%;">Art: Moses with The Ten Commandments by Joos van Gent</span></div>
