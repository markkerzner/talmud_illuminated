<br />
How can Shmuel contradict the <a href="https://talmudilluminated.com/bava_batra/bava_batra42.html" target="_blank">accepted rule that partners cannot establish chazakah</a>? – His version of this ruling was that they can. </span><span style="font-size: medium;">Shmuel</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> explains that it is normal for partners to expect regular returns from their field. If one occupied it for three consecutive years, he is believed to say that he bought his partner out, for otherwise, they would alternate more frequently.<br />
<br />
How can he testify for his partner if he is interested in the outcome? He needs to renounce his share.<br />
<br />
How are they <a href="https://talmudilluminated.com/bava_metzia/bava_metzia34.html" target="_blank">paid custodians liable for theft</a>? If they guard the field in turns, then each pays the other with his work.</span><div><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-size: medium;">Art: In the Wheat Field by Wlodzimierz Tetmajer<br />
