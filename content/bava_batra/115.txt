</div><span style="font-size: medium;">“...<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/27-8.htm%20">if a man should die, and he has no sons, you shall transfer his inheritance to his daughter.</a>” – A son takes precedence over a daughter. Moreover, all the descendants of a son take precedence over a daughter. <br />
<br />
However, a daughter takes precedence over the brothers of the deceased (her uncles), and the descendants of a daughter take precedence over brothers. The daughter also takes precedence over the father of the deceased (her grandfather).<br />
<br />
This is the rule: whoever takes precedence in the inheritance, his descendants too take precedence; and the father takes precedence over all his descendants – because the brothers of the deceased are related to him through their common father.<br />
