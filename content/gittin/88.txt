Concerning a Get procured by force, the Get is valid if the coercion was applied by the Jewish court and the husband acquiesced. But if the pressure was used by a court of idolaters, the Get is invalid. However, even in a court of idolaters, they may beat the husband and tell him, "Do what the Jewish court tells you to do!" the Get is valid.<div><br /></div><div>Art: Peasants Fighting by Adriaen Brouwer</div>
