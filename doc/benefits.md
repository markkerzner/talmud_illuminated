# Benefits of Talmud study for humanity

* Talmud is the hidden Bible. When the books of the Bible (Torah)
were written, a large compendium of laws and stories were kept out of the
Bible and instead taught orally, from teacher to student.
* After about two thousand years of such transmission, and due to the danger of the teaching being lost,
it was written down, in Hebrew and Aramaic.
* The twentieth century saw the translation in English, with the explanations.
* Talmud Illuminated is a unique compendium of summaries of each page, illustrated with a fitting choice from world art.
* It is thus a priceless body of knowledge the study of which will confer many benefits on the student. Here 
are some of these benefits listed below.

### Mental gymnastics

* Elderly people are advised to exercise their brains with card games, crossword puzzles, and other activities.
Much more powerful benefits will accrue to anyone who exercises their brains regularly. The obvious parallel between
intellectual study and exercising in the gym tells it all.
  
### Why is this study possible?

* With [Talmud Illuminated](http://talmudilluminated.com/welcome.html), 
  everyone can get the benefits listed below. Here every page is summarized in clear English.
  Moreover, it is made more enjoyable by a select artwork, interplaying with the text. 
  We will talk more about art later.

### Acquire business acumen

* Some part of the Talmud are especially conducive to learning how to conduct competitive yet fair business. These
deal with civil law, the study of which makes a person smart. Here is why. If one is asked if it is allowed to play chess
on a certain Festival day, one risks nothing by answering "No!" But in civil law you have two parties to the lawsuit. "No"
for one is "yes" for the other one. Thus, you need to know the exact reason for the "yes" or "no" answer. Finding these
reasons sharpens one's brain.  

### Acquire good character traits

* Often, people cause the greatest possible damage when angry. They say the thing that they later regret, or do an act.
  
* The ancient sage by the name of Hillel would not get angry even when provoked on purpose. Here is [how he did it] (https://talmudilluminated.com/shabbat/shabbat31.html).

### Acquire taste in art

* This is not, properly speaking the benefit of Talmud study. However, it definitely is the
benefit of [Talmud Illuminated](http://talmudilluminated.com/welcome.html).
  
* The art choice is done completely by a woman (my wife) and represent the breadth and depth
of her knowledge of art acquired originally growing up in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and then
continued through various means.
